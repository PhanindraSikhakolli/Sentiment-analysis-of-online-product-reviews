Please , Don't buy this product ""samsung galaxy M13"" specially from Amazon.This product I have purchased from Amazon, I faced the problem  .....The mobile is being hanged continuously and after inserting the sim the network is not showing........This problem I have discussed with customer care and first of all I wanted to return this product and I wanted to take my refund back but the thing is what they started a process like to send the technician to delivery address and after that the technician called that and we told him to visit our address and he forced not to come on delivery address. According to technician he said he will resolved the issue on call.....one application we installed that he want for testing purpose after that he sent screen-shot on my personal mobile number in that he had selected hardware issue and said that now you can return the product. But the main thing is I am unable to return this because there is no option available for this ...I tried to call the technician again, he is not recieving my call....so called customer care again....... we talked with customer care and what they said we will send the technician again...but we want our refund back but they forced me to send the technician again and repeat the process again.....But why should I do this process again this is not our fault.....I want my refund back.This product I had purchased for my mother and I have faced this problem.I request you all please don't buy this mobile or any mobile from Amazon... You can all face the same problem as we have faced....In logo paiso ki koi kadar nahi he.

DON'T BUY THIS PHONE
","
Bought it after seeing 4 star ratings and good! Reviews. But these days all these high ratings are fraud in India atleast. This phone is an example. Only two months after purchase display hangs and hangs and hangs despite deleting videos, apps and caches. This phone doesn't have screen mirroring facility.  Taking screenshots too could've been easier. Total disappointment and unworthy of money. DON'T PURCHASE.

Too slow processor
","
I want this product for normal use.....But the Exynos processor is too slow unable to use the phone properly from day 1 ....I have to report an error to the care for the optimization of the phone.... But their reply is to run the Test.Hence, Facing the same problem even after run a test.

Not worth the hype and money - Samsung should look at the design quality of M13
","
I had to replace the phone since it was stopping while playing videos and the touch wasn't working. I got a replacement phone and it has the same problems though touch is slightly better. The video playing either won't stop even if you push back button or will keep stopping intermittently as if buffering even with a 100MBps wifi or mobile data. I had to repair by broken Redmi with no option left and it work wonders.I suggest people can skip this phone for a better one. Samsung should look at the design quality of M13

The M series phone have software .

The M aeries range software are damaged. Samsung offline store sales person said that Samsung has compromised with quality to give features at this price . The M series phone have software defect.  Paccessing internet and need to restart again &again. The Samsung store person said that no offline store is selling M series due to manufacturing defect.

Bad display. Contacts app is very pathetic
","
Display is way way way pathetic and dull. No contrasts...gives a feel that oil is spilled over screen. Phone needs to be operated at very high brightness settings.If you have saved a contact without adding+91 which generally is the case... it's not showing the name of saved contact because you have not saved +91 in your contact details.This kind of problem I am facing for the first time in any phone.Even non smart phones worth rs 2000k will show the name of contact if the main 10 digits are correct.This phone is not displaying contact just because you have saved  0 in place of +91 or just saved the 10 digits....

Don't waste your money in this phone.
","
Don't waste your money on this phone. Forget about any app installation. Phone is not working with the pre-installed app. Even I have uninstalled few pre-installed app still phone hanged and not working as a normal phone. I have to restart multiple times for a normal operation. Phone is too slow to operate and full of junks. Phone got hanged if you open the settings. So don't waste your time and money on this phone.

Worst mobile
","
The samsung and Amazon both fooled people.This is the first time I have tried to return a mobile and had worst experience with Amazon.Key Issues with mobile: Quickly device getting hot. Very much irritated during calls Battery drainage quicklyWorst Amazon support When I reached the CS support, they asked me to wait for a technical agent visit.  But the assigned technical agent left Amazon for more than year and I ended up co-ordinating with  CS support and that person.Again the next person avoided a personal visit and put me on a Minspect app and verified for few min. (Worst app at all and they promised for a personal visit but ended up on-call check)Again after a new call to the support team, they have agreed for a refund and asked me to update my pan card. But Again a new CS person refused that policy 🙄 🤔I don't know whether the intention of CS support is yo solve customer query or to time pass with us to feel irritated

Samsung M13  5G Phone  is not Good. Every  thing is slow .
","
I like  Samsung  but  Samsung M13  5G Phone  is not Good. Every  thing is slow . apps  are not  work  smoothly. So I think  you should  not buy it. Present time Samsung phone quality  is very poor  they should improve it . Present  time  Chinese  companies  phone  work  better  than  Samsung  but I hate Chinese  companies.

mediocre laggy device
","
I bought this for my dad who is currently using M21 1st edition. Let me list down pros and consPros:1. 6000 mah battery2. Branded device. Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.3. Charger included in box (15w)Cons:1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery3.  very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.

Don't buy it...I have bought phn from Amazon thrice...but in previous 2times there was no issue...now in the 3rd time I have bought this phn everything is alright but YouTube is lagging very much...so I went to the app and tried to return the phn...but Amazon didn't allow me to return the product as they were suggesting to book an appointment with their technician but they didn't have any technician present in this 1 week return time...so that's why I can't return the product now I have to use it...don't know whether it will show any more lags on other apps☹️☹️☹️so guys may be the price is low nd the offer seems good but I would again suggest u to think again before buying any phn not only this

Device performance
","
battery life, fingerprint reader are good. But there is lot of noise while taking foto in low light condition.One must also look the performance of the device. For the price range it's ok but there is drop in performance and frame rate while scrolling through Google news and youtube. Not only these there are lots of lag while using. I have been using m13 4g for 7 days. If you want to buy then go for the M13 5g model which offer more fluidity since it runs on MT D700 (7nm technology) which is more better performance  the exynos 850. Think carefully while buying.

DON'T BUY THIS PHONE
","
Bought it after seeing 4 star ratings and good! Reviews. But these days all these high ratings are fraud in India atleast. This phone is an example. Only two months after purchase display hangs and hangs and hangs despite deleting videos, apps and caches. This phone doesn't have screen mirroring facility.  Taking screenshots too could've been easier. Total disappointment and unworthy of money. DON'T PURCHASE.

Not worth the hype and money - Samsung should look at the design quality of M13
","
I had to replace the phone since it was stopping while playing videos and the touch wasn't working. I got a replacement phone and it has the same problems though touch is slightly better. The video playing either won't stop even if you push back button or will keep stopping intermittently as if buffering even with a 100MBps wifi or mobile data. I had to repair by broken Redmi with no option left and it work wonders.I suggest people can skip this phone for a better one. Samsung should look at the design quality of M13

Bad display. Contacts app is very pathetic
","
Display is way way way pathetic and dull. No contrasts...gives a feel that oil is spilled over screen. Phone needs to be operated at very high brightness settings.If you have saved a contact without adding+91 which generally is the case... it's not showing the name of saved contact because you have not saved +91 in your contact details.This kind of problem I am facing for the first time in any phone.Even non smart phones worth rs 2000k will show the name of contact if the main 10 digits are correct.This phone is not displaying contact just because you have saved  0 in place of +91 or just saved the 10 digits....

Worst mobile
","
The samsung and Amazon both fooled people.This is the first time I have tried to return a mobile and had worst experience with Amazon.Key Issues with mobile: Quickly device getting hot. Very much irritated during calls Battery drainage quicklyWorst Amazon support When I reached the CS support, they asked me to wait for a technical agent visit.  But the assigned technical agent left Amazon for more than year and I ended up co-ordinating with  CS support and that person.Again the next person avoided a personal visit and put me on a Minspect app and verified for few min. (Worst app at all and they promised for a personal visit but ended up on-call check)Again after a new call to the support team, they have agreed for a refund and asked me to update my pan card. But Again a new CS person refused that policy 🙄 🤔I don't know whether the intention of CS support is yo solve customer query or to time pass with us to feel irritated

mediocre laggy device
","
I bought this for my dad who is currently using M21 1st edition. Let me list down pros and consPros:1. 6000 mah battery2. Branded device. Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.3. Charger included in box (15w)Cons:1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery3.  very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.

battery life, fingerprint reader are good. But there is lot of noise while taking foto in low light condition.One must also look the performance of the device. For the price range it's ok but there is drop in performance and frame rate while scrolling through Google news and youtube. Not only these there are lots of lag while using. I have been using m13 4g for 7 days. If you want to buy then go for the M13 5g model which offer more fluidity since it runs on MT D700 (7nm technology) which is more better performance  the exynos 850. Think carefully while buying.

WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT
","
Purchase this or anything on Amazon at your own risk, customer support is not going to help.My unit had a physical defect, gaps on the sides from the back panel and it's a serious issue considering the phone is ip68 rated (water resistant) and this gap can cause water damage. Poor quality control as I saw some other customers reporting same issue and some units also getting water damage and then Samsung can't help there.First, they can't replace directly now. Some technician will visit and verify the issue however no one called or showed up and then I get an email saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Support Reps on chat are disconnecting the chat saying they can't do anything, there's a different team for these issues which is rude. It's been more than 24 hours and no one joined that chat and yet I was told ""I have option to keep this chat window open so have you can get connect with your concern team""Lastly, cherry on top is that they CAN'T change the address for the Technician's visit even if you're not at the same location where the order was delivered. Due to this, I had to wait 4 hours on a different location for the Technician's visit and no one came except for the email later saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Basically, you're on own after purchasing from Amazon. Think before making bigger purchases.Update: Still unresolved and denied further supportAfter a week of back and forth, finally a replacement was created however it wasn't delivered. For 5 days straight, it kept saying ""Now arriving today"" and ""Rescheduled"" and it's just stuck there.After countless hours with ~15 support and escalation agents (they all have technical issues when I ask a question), one of them canceled the order in hurry and now they can't create a new replacement order. Asking me to return the defective phone and place a new order which is by paying 6500/- more whereas I placed the order on sale for 23.5k. One agent promised that he'll refund the new order but he disconnected the chat and the next agent is not respective that offer.Currently, I'm stuck with the defective phone and support team disconnected the chat even while talking and said we can't help you anymore. That Agent also sent an email with numerous links pushing the survey links to bottom and interestingly, he modified the survey URL's domain from Amazon.in to Amazon.co.uk to avoid feedback and this was by the either by the Escalations or Leadership team.Not just the frontline Support team, Escalations and Leadership teams are also irresponsible and have such unethical and unprofessional behavior. Not to mention, no one wants to check the previous chats, you have to repeat every single thing all over again and I've done this for 2 weeks with more than 15 Agents.Next: I'm taking this social media and consumer forums.

Very very IMP to read if you are planning to buy S20 FE 5G - Known display issue
","
Ever wondered why this model is also sold a large numbers which are refurbished? Thats because it has a display issue which are noticed within one month of purchase and if such phone arrives at service centre they replace them with another one with new phone if bought from offline store (if bought from amazon then they will repair only and you need to live with it). Then samsung repairs the faulty phone and sells as refurbished by the dealers. Otherwise such a latest model wouldnt have so many refurbished phones.Now below is my purchase experience.I bought this phone on 11th Aug 22 and on 19th Aug the display automatically stopped working. Since Amazon provides replacement for 7 days so I couldnt replace - I dont consider myself as unlucky because its the problem with most of the Samsung S20 FE 5G models, and if you go to Samsung customer review site you can see many customers complaining about it globally. Also if you visit Samsung Service Centre in India and just sit there for few hours then high chances 1-2 persons would come with this issue.I mailed to Samsung, Amazon and requested for replacement since it was a manufacturing issue but no one listened, I twitted but no help - just some usual response came from both Samsung and Amazon. Amazon said since 7 days passed so they cant help. Samsung said they dont replace online bought products although they have 14 days replacement policy but that is only for offline products.I was frustrated and raised greivance at consumer forum but there also Samsung said they cant replace the product since its purchased from Amazon. And after no help I asked Samsung Service Centre to repair the product to which they said they need to check if it was a physical damange or liquid damage etc. and they first scared me saying it looks like I messed with the product but later agreed when managed to convince them sitting the whole day in the service centre. now they are saying the screen isnt available or they are not able to order. I am holding the dead phone for almost a month now. If you are planning to buy this phone then consider yourself lucky and learn from my pathetic experience and just dont buy this phone. Better buy any other phone but not Samsung's.

A Phone with known screen black dead problem! Stay away from Samsung.
","
I bought this phone with high hopes, it worked fine for few days, but within 2 weeks screen went black. On checking the samsung forums and amazon reviews, I understood this is a known problem and there are many customers, probably almost everyone facing this same issue who got it online. Now probably its my turn to go to service centre. I am really surprised to see Samsung neglecting customers that too S series buyers. There are some cases where consumers have raised cases vs Samsung but no response. I sincerely request Amazon to stop selling such items with known issues, as they spoil your reputation. I know Samsung is a big giant, so was Micromax and Lava at one point. We trust Amazon on their reliability and quality, but such incidents spoil the whole experience. I already told my friend to buy offline and go for Oneplus as don't want him to face this challenge.One day Samsung will learn and pay for their ignorance towards customers like us. Now there are thousands who will never buy Samsung just because of their experience with S20 FE 5G. A sensible company will recall such products from consumers or provide them a permanent fix.I too pledge never to buy a Samsung mobile in future.Update: Visited the Service centre and they replaced the display and returned the mobile same day in few hours. I have not got extended warranty as am skeptical how long the display will last, so better to cover for 2 years. Post which we can say that investment was spent over.The only good thing is Service centre had spare display ready(probably anticipating all S20 users will visit at some point). The Person ahead of me was also visiting the centre with same issue of same model, so its evident that its mass batch issue. Ideally Samsung should recall and withdraw such products from market. Anyway probably Samsung know better what to be done, but my next mobile will never be Samsung.

Don't buy this model
","
Please do not buy samsung phones. I have bought Samsung S20 FE 5G phone before 20 days. My phone display has stopped working working now. I have seen many videos on your tube then I realized that it is common problem in this phone. Samsung service center is accepting it is manufacturing defect. However company is not ready to replace the phone. There are saying that only repair is possible. Which is  I ma fine with. All I want in return that send me confirmation on mail that same issue will not arise in future but they are not even ready to take guarantee for their own product. (THIS IS WHAT THIS BRAND IS). I have put my hard earn money on this phone.  I have visited service center for 6 time and have called in customer number many times yet there is not solution. Please if any one can guide me how to escalate this issue. It would be very much helpful.Updates. I am following up the company since last 25 days yet there is no solution from their end.I am have done so many research on it. It is manufacturing defect Samsung service center executive has told me that. I have all the proof. I am planning to file complain in court now. They are selling sub standard products. This my last Samsung phone which anyways I am not going to use it.  I will raise compensation demand in cash. Those who wants to file case. We can file a case in group as well. As we are facing same dead display problem (Display Blackout ). There are not just spoiling their image. Amazon has to look into this matter  as well. Please those wants to file case can join contact me on my email id girishpatel2433@gmail.com

Substandard product from samsung
","
I purchased it on 24 sep and on 23rd October morning after charging, the screen went blank(BSOD) and I cant use the mobile. 23 and 24 are service center holidays and on 25 th service center after taking around 1 hr time and opening my mobile confirmed that display is gone and needs to be replaced. Displays are out of stock and asked for 4-5 days time. Having no other option and as return window is closed by 1st October, i agreed . Still in warranty, hopefully the display replacement is free of cost. I met other guy with same issue same model and same one month usage.Seems this is a sub standard product from samsung. This is my first phone from samsung and used mobiles starting from Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, One Plus..this is my first visit to any mobile service center in the last 20 years or so. Totally disappointed with samsung.Just hoping the replaced display will come longer.Huge discount on this model in sale , may be I should have not fallen. Bye bye samsung after this phone.Update:I got mobile back on 29th Oct and display was replaced free of cost as it was under warranty. But lost all my Data(which was informed) and had to setup again from scratch.Just hoping this will not happen again even after warranty.Pretty sure this is my last mobile from samsung. Bye bye.Update2:Iam seeing lot of reviews where in many mentioning its issue with Amazon purchased mobiles only, NO, I met 2 guys when Iam in service center and both had purchased from the same store where service center is located. So its issue with Samsung doesnt matter it is store purchase or Amazon.

Screen black out issue within 15 min of delivery.

I got the order on 27th evening. I opened the package inserted the sim and started the phone while selecting the wifi option the screen went black. Phone was having 58% charge it is vibrating or making sound if I try to charge it.Imediately contacted customer care they said technician will come and see what is the issue. and they will proceed for the exchange. If any one went through this please let me know what solution did you got from this ?Now waiting for the Technician. I will update how this process goes..Day 2.Appointmnet for technician was fixed after 2 days.slot was 10 am to 2 pm. got a text message from amazon that I will be there till 10.30am.but thechinical guy did not show up. tried calling CC they assured they will arange it till 2pm but it was not done they have booked other slot after 2 days again.Now waiting for the next day.  I will update what the day unfolds on that day.Amazon Policy : ( As described by amazon customer care )1. They can only replace or refund ( whatever option available ) when the techincal guy give there report  to the amazon.  And there have been many cases where technical guy have submited a wrong report to amazon at last  customer suffers in this case.2. Amazon dose not have any control over the techincal service.  They can't find out where the technical person is they can't contact them they even can't communicate  with them. I don't know how amazon approve this kind of Important service on which they dont have  any control.

Phone Screen went dead in 10 days after purchase!
","
Please do your research about the phone before you buy this phone.I bought this phone from Amazon during the Dussehra Sale Offer and I was quite happy with the Amazon fast delivery. But after 10 days of use, one morning the phone screen went blank n dead.  The phone was working as i could hear the incoming call ringtone and also the phone vibrate but mobile screen was blackout.So immediately I took the phone to the nearest Samsung service center and told them the issue. Initially they said don't worry sir since it's just 10 days from activation Samsung has complete product return n replacement policy. But then when I said it's bought from Amazon they said sorry sir in that case we just have only the warranty coverage and no complete replacement applicable! Also, when I was in the service center seeing my samsung s20 fe box fellow customers who also had similar problem called out to me asking ""oh! same issue ah!"". There were 2 customers with similar issue (phone screen blackout in few days from purchase) on that day.I feel something is not right about the Samsung s20 fe 5G as a complete product. Maybe some QA check's were comprised before the product market release. If it's just one-off instance of similar issue we can ignore and say like 1 in 100 issue can happen but that's not the case here. I asked the Samsung CC person how many such issues reported, she said with a smile, yeah quite a few similar customer issues reported!

Black screen of death
","
Bought this during one of the sales for a decent amount of discount. But within a month of buying this phone the screen stopped working. It just went blank while I was browsing. I thought the phone shut down and kept trying to turn it on. But it wasn't responding. So I started removing the sim to put in a different phone and the phone made a sound as soon as the tray popped out, that's when I realised the phone is on but the screen had shut off.After some googling I found that this is fairly common for Samsung phones. It's been happening for many years and Samsung hasn't bothered to fix it. If only I had known this before buying the phone...This had even happened to my father's phone some 5 or so years ago. But it started back up after the phone battery discharged completely a day later, and didn't have a problem after that so brushed it off as a one off issue and didn't really look into it too much. Wasn't as lucky with this phone, will be going to a Samsung service center soon, lets see how that goes.Wanted to buy Samsung foldables in the future, but hesitant of Samsung phones in general now. Especially since this is a fairly frequent issue and they haven't bothered to fix it after so many years. And foldables have their own screen issues as well.Until this issue cropped up I was fairly happy with this phone. I would have given it 4.5 stars. One point that did bother me a bit was the weight. This thing is heavier and bulkier in hand than the M52 that my father has, despite having a smaller battery. I guess it is the better cameras and a metal frame addibg some weight. Premium touches no doubt, but the M52 is a bit more comfortable to hold in the hand and it has a marginally bigger screen and battery.  Anyway not a big deal, it was a good phone overall.

The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Just in 2 days after delivery

The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Phone was delivered on 02/10/22 and stopped working on 04/10/22. Phone screen gose completely black out suddenly while using. And now not starting. I tried to replace this via Amazon app but the option is not available their the only option is to get the technician visit and the slot is not available for technicain visit. After calling the Amazon customer care i got appointment for 07/10/22.I am editing this review today on 14/10/22 now my phone is replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Amazon and their customer support team. Now my phone is working fine.But i have one doubt if i i have got the new phone or not. The box was sealed but when I opened their was some dirt stick on the phone. As the phone screen guard was their. Also the charging adaptor was not properly at its place.  It seem that in transit these was displaced. But generally this dose not happen. As the package is made in such a way to avoid these displacementI want to ask Samsung and Amazone if they are supplying phone with screen guard applyed on Galaxy S20FE 5G. And durt on the screen guard. Is it standerd from Samsung. I think definitely not. Request Amazone and Samsung to clearify this. I have a doubt the phone i got is refurbished. I request Samsung to clearify my doubt by checking the sl no. And IMIE no. In their records.

FE means Fool's Edition
","
Screen - So-called Samsung's AMOLED is hype. It took me a lot of time to adjust to this screen because the colors are inaccurate.I'm using vivid mode with the white balance slider turned all the way to the right, i.e. warm.120Hz is a gimmick on this phone. You are forced to use it because 60Hz is unrealistically laggy. Compared to the aged Pixel 2XL, this phone is in no way faster by any means.Moreover, the refresh rate is not adaptive, therefore, battery drain is horrible.Speakers - Average, lack natural bass. The overall sound is on the sharper side.Battery - Poor. Don't trust screen on time. You have to charge it twice a day. I don't know what kind of a person is ""mild"" in this day and age.Performance - Software is poorly optimized. Performance is not good. It doesn't feel like a flagship.No headphone jack, but that's okay, nobody likes music anymore.Expandable storage - This is the only pro, everything else is a con. They removed this one too in S21 FE.Camera - Why do people say colors are subjective? Who purposefully likes unnatural oversaturated greens of foliage, exaggerated reds, and blues which look like they are painted on with a double brush?The overall photo is childish and basic. Compared to the Google Pixel 2, this camera is crap.And the camera app lags like crazy. It takes irritatingly long to get into the camera app, for it to be ready for clicking a shot.Ultrawide cameras are all gimmicks, so much more especially in this phone.Telephoto lacks resolution.The video quality is decent.The fingerprint sensor is horrible. Painful, really painful. You will curse it.Software - Thankfully no ads but miles away from the stock experience. Even though it has 865 SD, it feels like a middle-range phone. No, the software is NOT snappy. There are no glaring lags either but just not what you would expect. Or perhaps my expectations from a Samsung phone are unreasonable. Updates ain't so fast either. Samsung treats FE models as an afterthought.Bottom line - Don't buy this phone even if it sells for a single rupee above 30K. I made a mistake. Look elsewhere, don't be fooled by a ""near-flagship"" experience because there is none.

I have brought this phone on august 2022 on sale for 28600, That was a great deal for this phone and I have never seen this phone in this price range. I feel heating issue at first 2 days of use  while charging, streaming Youtube and playing games(BGMI). But after software update it seems fine and doesn't have that much heating issue any more. overall the phone looks good, camera is great and a descent battery life (1 day life with streaming + browsing + call ), finger print scanner is ok not that best in market. Battery wont be enough if you are a gamer.The real issue came after 3 months of use, one day the SCREEN got BLACKED OUT while using message app. I m a Samsung fan and I have been using Samsung phone's for around 15 year. This is the first time I m facing such an issue( only freezing issue found in previous phones ), it can be restarted but screen will be blacked out after a while. and it got fixed by SCREEN REPLACEMENT from service center. And the ISSUE is there for more users who PURCHASED on SALE DAY, some people already logged this in Samsung community. Only because of this I'm giving this phone a 2 star review.

Very disappointed product from Samsung
","
Very very disappointed, I never expected this kind of product from Samsung.Within 20 days (accurately after 17days of usage), the phone suddenly showed a black screen even though vibration and other things were working in the background. The black screen was not resolved even after trying hard booting many times. Since it was more than 14 days Service center team member told me that it can't be replaced but can be repaired.After an initial investigation, it was communicated that it is a defective piece. The screen and battery needed to be replaced. The estimated service time was 1 day.The next day when I enquired, they told me that the parts are not yet arrived and it will take 2 more days, Hoping that there will be no further delay.I never faced this kind of problem with Xiaomi phones before, I think I made the wrong decision to switch to Samsung phones. It has caused so much trouble as I am not able to authenticate my authentication on some of the cloud portals due to this issue.The only good point which made to buy this phone was the camera quality,  But what is the use of having a good camera when the phone itself is very unstable and has a black screen issue?

Much better options available in same range don't go for it

Camera clarity not good, even six years old  redmi note 6 has better camera then this I mean you can't compare its worst. Display is not up to the mark even samsung's own under 20k phones has better camera and display then this then why someone should go for this don't get fooled by online review they are all managed .

Problem with Amazon
","
I have been using Samsung products since 2007. First time unhappy with Samsung Galaxy S20 FE due to Amazon. Amazon is buying defective products and selling with little lower price than market. I would suggest not to buy Smart phones through Amazon.

Shocking poor build quality
","
Bought in Jun 2022, delivered on 25th Jun, I find this hardware button to be broken/disassociated on Nov 5, 2022. Lucky for me, the part got lodged in my pocket and I could put a cello-tape and sort of fix it (jugaad). However, this has convinced me to not go with Samsung products anymore. The quality is deteriorating. BTW, the phone never fell from my hand, had a protector almost immediately. Now of course, Samsung will claim I (or my kids, or somebody else) MUST have dropped it. I have spent too much of time setting this up, and I can't give it to anybody without a huge inconvenience.Photo taken on iPhone bought in Feb 2021, (for context), fell twice till now, also has protectors, going strong.

Not a good deal
","
It's been one month since I got trapped.1. Battery life is average. It takes a lot of time to get fully charged. If u use the phone while charging, it will take more than 5hrs for fully charged2. Back camera is very nice, but selfie camera is waste. U can't make quality reels and u will look like chudel in video calling. No flash for selfie camera in this price range.3. Touch is just ok.4. Phone is a bit heavy.5. Not worth for 30k at all. Think twice before you buy this 🤔.Note - I listed it on OLX already

"
With this price go with one plus
","
The price at which you are getting this phone...... you cab go with one plus either....one plus has good battery backup with fast charging support... even after spending 30k on Samsung we are not getting fast charging support...it only offers 25w that too you have to buy adapter separately.The seller has taken away too much time to deliver as well... no issue with product recevied the product in best condition.

Mobile suddenly and silently stopped display. Don't recommend this model.

I brought this mobile few days before Dusara festival as I had my old MI mobile and wanted a new one. Thought to buy Samsung as it is very popular one and went for this Samsung Galaxy 20 FE. Used it for 2-3 weeks very carefully as it was new mobile and wanted to keep it safe till Diwali at least :). I had my personal data and office apps on it. 2 days back i kept it near me and was doing office work. had to call my colleague for urgent work in the weekend and this mobile stopped display and had to suffer a lot as i had my office app, contact numbers etc and even UPI apps on it.now i am unable to return it from AMAZON website. Need to call Samsung customer care...don't know how is the support from Samsung. I would suggest not to go for this model.

Extremely disappointed with the Battery
","
The phone is great in many aspects; I purchased it even after reading about its average battery life, but I’m highly disappointed after 1 week of usage even after starting with low expectations.I charged my iPhone 12 and Samsung S20fe to 100% last night and left them on my desk when I slept; this morning when I woke up, the iPhone is still at 100% whereas Samsung is at 92% (after 8 hrs of no usage)On normal days (with screen on time of 2-3 hrs) the battery doesn’t even last till the evening, and this is despite 60hz refresh rate and turning off several battery consuming features like NFC, nearby device scanning, location, Auto app updates, several personalisation features. I checked in the setting and it says 3% was used by google play services, 1% WhatsApp and % Samsung store. I’ve set all of these apps on the most minimalist modes, and yet have this battery drain.Regret buying this phone. Feels like Samsung and Amazon sold me lemon by discounting it heavily

Wondering if it's a flagship!
","
This doesn't come with 25w charger and headsets out of box for such premium price.You have to buy it manually.Usb C to 3.5 jack adapter from samsung only works, if you like to use existing headset, so that's an additional purchase.If you're buying in 2022, you may get android update in Mar 2023 and security update till 2024.Observing heating issue while charging with regular 15w charger.Hope this helps!

Not really a flagship

In call sound is so loud. It's irritating. Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use headphones/headsets/earbuds,etc.  everytime while speaking. Or if you can use loudspeaker..And remember they have aped Apple hence no 3.5mm jack slot. Either Bluetooth or wired headset with type c cable.

Reviewing after 2 months of usage as my Primary device..
","
This is totally my personal opinion about the phone, there are too many aspects to talk about and it will definitely help you with your buying...1. Look and build: (8 out of 10)  Firstly it is a good-looking phone for me, simple and sober, with a metallic frame the phone feels good on the hands too, back made of plastic and not too prone to scratches, even I dropped it a couple of times but it is fine as of now. So the plastic build is a key for those who don't use covers. but you must regret not having a 3.5mm jack.2. DIsplay: (7 out of 10) To be honest display is good but not as good as other Samsung flagship, I was using it along with the Samsung S9 and Realme X2pro side by side on 1080p resolution but the s9 and X2pro look more sharp and bright as compared, Pixel density and brightness nits are satisfactory but not issue in outdoors. overall the display looks good.3. Performace:(7 out of 10) It is the key part for me, with regular day-to-day tasks, multitasking app switching everything is fine unless it comes to gaming. the device comes with SD865 and on paper, it is a very good  SOC for performance and for gaming also, but Samsung doing it very wrong in the part of gaming, I m daily driver Bgmi player and I play it a lot, in the term of gaming performance it works really poor as compared to my Realme X2pro with SD 855plus. with the smooth extreme setting, there are high Visible frame drops and stutters. frames drop as low as 40-35 fps as compared to X2pro which continues to maintain 55-60 fps. Samsung does not work well on gaming optimization. So as my view who looks for a good gaming phone go for Realme Oneplus or other but if gaming is not that matter then definitely go for this.4. Camera:(9 out of 10) It is another key point for me, the camera performance on this phone looks excellent, I am fond of photography and for me, the camera works really well on color balance dynamic range, etc. wide-angle camera and portrait mode is excellent and the sensor works really good on low light conditions. the primary sensor OIS works really well but Video mode with the wide-angle lens is missing. Samsung must add it with updates. Overall the camera is really good.5. Battery: (8 out of 10)4500 mah is kind of enough for a mid-user. it typically lasts for a day most of the time. Battery management and optimization are good. But for the heavy users with heavy app load and background load the phone needs to charge more than one time a day.6. multimedia:(9 out of 10) Videos and movie watching experience is fun on this as the volume is loud and the Dolby sound and stereo effect works really well.7.UI:(8 out of 10) Samsung One UI looks clean and good but comes with lots of preinstalled bloatware ( some of them are uninstallable ) and adds( can be disabled while device setup or from the settings) and Android 11 and Samsung Nox security is a key part of this phone as the device comes with hardware base extra layer of security. and Samsung is good at pushing regular security updates and 3 years platform update. and it makes the device future-proof.8. Network reception:(9 out of 10) I am using airtel as primary sim. there is not carrier aggregation in my area. but devices support it also it supports Vowifi and dual-band WIFI so no issue with the network reception.I brought it for 41k with an extra 7k discount. and it kind of value of money for me because of the Brand name. and it is a really good phone from Samsung. but in this price segment, and there are lots of other options to look for.

It is a wonderful mobile mainly in camera performance was very impressively and i am big fan of Samsung mobiles that's why i bought this mobile and i am fully satisfied but there is some cons also there like battery was drained early and charge mobile twice a day and fingerprint was slowly however overall product was very good and reasonable to buy

Bought this for Rs 26500 and worth every penny
","
Even though this phone was launched 2 years back but 865 processor is still worth Rs 26500. The Camera is just amazing! other mid-rangers like M52 , A52s etc. are not even close.The battery is decent but since my usage includes normal day-to-day functions - WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome,5-10 photo clicks and some paytm types app and I set the refresh rate to 60Hz, I am able to use it for 2 days easily on single charge. The phone comes by default with screen guard which is not tempered glass but does provide some protection. The back cover is glasstic and needs some protection, Either the phone cover is such that or best is to get a film protection for its back as well just like screen.Overall Battery is 8.5/10(For normal usage where 60Hz refresh rate is also fine)Camera is 10/10, front Camera  =  9/10Performance for normal user = 10/10(Not sure about gamers)In-Hand Feel is perfect= 9/10Screen Quality  = 10/10

Very Smooth phone

It has a fast refresh rate of 120hz. The colors are saturated as usual in a Super Amoled panel. The display is very bright as well. It is very smooth.UI:Packed of features. There is no doubt that Samsung is one of the best UI out there for Android.Battery:The phone has 4500mah. Easily lasts a day. Could last even longer if used in 60hz. The phone supports upto 25w charging. It also supports reverse charging. It even supports reverse wireless charging!!Performance: A top of the line processor by Samsung. Would've been better if the indian version had gotten the Snapdragon 865 chipset. But the 5g Version does have SD 865 but it is much more costlier.Camera:The camera sure is 12MP but it takes much more details than expected by a 12MP camera. It is a very capable capable unit under bright environments. But you can see lots of noise in dark environments.Finaly.Cons:1. Battery drains fast.2. It supports 25W charging but comes with 15W charger.3. Little Heating problem.Pros:1. Fully water proof.(IP68 Rated).2. Powerful Processor.3. Camera is super good.

Amazon screwed up delivery for the first time. I cancelled and ordered again after a week availing exchange offer. Plus, got discount on using a certain credi card. For 25k, this is a fantastic phone. The camera is outstanding. I have a DSLR and can confidently say that this pictures from this phone are as good as that, quality wise. Thanks to 8GB RAM, the phone functions smoothly. The screen resolution is top notch. I read a lot of complaints on screen conking off after few days. It's been 10 days since I have been using the phone. Thankfully, no issues for me yet. Hoping for the best 😄 The phone charges very quickly and battery life is very good for a moderate user like me who doesn't watch too many videos or okays games. Overall a fantastic phone at this price range. Go for it 👍👍

S20 FE 5g is very good product. I like the look and feel . Its real nice. Network connectivity is excellent. I get good 4G plus network.  5g is still not launched in my city. So can't talk about 5g. Bettery optimisation is very good. And nothing to say more about the software experience.  Its Samsung One UI. Just Great , no lag , no bug . I find it like this. So finally it a very good product by Samsung.

Best Midrange mobile at 30k
","
Bought this for 30k (In prime sale + Bank offers and No COST EMI).Screen: Absolutely stunning, it supports 60Hz and 120Hz. It doesn't switch automatically between these settings, you need to select it from settings.Rear Camera: Really nice, seriously good. Not just good enough.Front camera - A bit disappointed, it's good but not as good as rear camera.Performance - You can play games like Call of duty or BGMI at Max graphics settings that the game supports. It heats up a bit after playing for a hour. Which is absolutely normal considering it has Snapdragon 865 and as saying goes with great processors comes a little bit of heatings. Just know that it's normal, don't expect any mobile to not heatup while charging or doing heavy works. That's universal.Finger Print reader - Good, no complains. Won't feel any significant delay or issues.Charger - It comes with 15W USB type C charger and it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to fully charge the battery. Mobile however supports upto 25W charger and it also supports wireless charging which I haven't tested. Don't buy a separate 25W charger for this, because the 25W charger takes only 10 minutes less than 15W charger to fully charge it.Sim cards - Supports 2 5G sim cards and upto 1TB (confirm this) expandable storage. However the slot is hybrid, it means you can't use both sim cards and external memory card at once. Either use both sim cards or 1 Sim card and external memory card.I don't think you will need external memory card because it has 128GB internal storage which is enough for normal users.It comes with Android 12 and Samsung one UI 4.1 and will support updates upto Android 13.It doesn't have headphone jack.Box contains - Mobile, Charger and Charger cable. Sim ejector.Amazon usually have discount (without prime sale), so don't buy without any discounts.As of August 2022, Expect it around 30k to 33k. Don't buy above this price because it randomly comes down to this price on some days.Personal suggestion: buy a cover ASAP. I droped it next morning and fortunately nothing broke, got a scratch around camera bump. Camera bump is made of glass-ish stuff and it can break very easily. So just keep that in mind.

Not worth the hype and money - Samsung should look at the design quality of M13

I had to replace the phone since it was stopping while playing videos and the touch wasn't working. I got a replacement phone and it has the same problems though touch is slightly better. The video playing either won't stop even if you push back button or will keep stopping intermittently as if buffering even with a 100MBps wifi or mobile data. I had to repair by broken Redmi with no option left and it work wonders.I suggest people can skip this phone for a better one. Samsung should look at the design quality of M13

Display is way way way pathetic and dull. No contrasts...gives a feel that oil is spilled over screen. Phone needs to be operated at very high brightness settings.If you have saved a contact without adding+91 which generally is the case... it's not showing the name of saved contact because you have not saved +91 in your contact details.This kind of problem I am facing for the first time in any phone.Even non smart phones worth rs 2000k will show the name of contact if the main 10 digits are correct.This phone is not displaying contact just because you have saved  0 in place of +91 or just saved the 10 digits....

Worst mobile

The samsung and Amazon both fooled people.This is the first time I have tried to return a mobile and had worst experience with Amazon.Key Issues with mobile: Quickly device getting hot. Very much irritated during calls Battery drainage quicklyWorst Amazon support When I reached the CS support, they asked me to wait for a technical agent visit.  But the assigned technical agent left Amazon for more than year and I ended up co-ordinating with  CS support and that person.Again the next person avoided a personal visit and put me on a Minspect app and verified for few min. (Worst app at all and they promised for a personal visit but ended up on-call check)Again after a new call to the support team, they have agreed for a refund and asked me to update my pan card. But Again a new CS person refused that policy 🙄 🤔I don't know whether the intention of CS support is yo solve customer query or to time pass with us to feel irritated

mediocre laggy device
","
I bought this for my dad who is currently using M21 1st edition. Let me list down pros and consPros:1. 6000 mah battery2. Branded device. Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.3. Charger included in box (15w)Cons:1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery3.  very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.

Don't buy it...I have bought phn from Amazon thrice...but in previous 2times there was no issue...now in the 3rd time I have bought this phn everything is alright but YouTube is lagging very much...so I went to the app and tried to return the phn...but Amazon didn't allow me to return the product as they were suggesting to book an appointment with their technician but they didn't have any technician present in this 1 week return time...so that's why I can't return the product now I have to use it...don't know whether it will show any more lags on other apps☹️☹️☹️so guys may be the price is low nd the offer seems good but I would again suggest u to think again before buying any phn not only this

Device performance
","
battery life, fingerprint reader are good. But there is lot of noise while taking foto in low light condition.One must also look the performance of the device. For the price range it's ok but there is drop in performance and frame rate while scrolling through Google news and youtube. Not only these there are lots of lag while using. I have been using m13 4g for 7 days. If you want to buy then go for the M13 5g model which offer more fluidity since it runs on MT D700 (7nm technology) which is more better performance  the exynos 850. Think carefully while buying.

WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT
","
Purchase this or anything on Amazon at your own risk, customer support is not going to help.My unit had a physical defect, gaps on the sides from the back panel and it's a serious issue considering the phone is ip68 rated (water resistant) and this gap can cause water damage. Poor quality control as I saw some other customers reporting same issue and some units also getting water damage and then Samsung can't help there.First, they can't replace directly now. Some technician will visit and verify the issue however no one called or showed up and then I get an email saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Support Reps on chat are disconnecting the chat saying they can't do anything, there's a different team for these issues which is rude. It's been more than 24 hours and no one joined that chat and yet I was told ""I have option to keep this chat window open so have you can get connect with your concern team""Lastly, cherry on top is that they CAN'T change the address for the Technician's visit even if you're not at the same location where the order was delivered. Due to this, I had to wait 4 hours on a different location for the Technician's visit and no one came except for the email later saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Basically, you're on own after purchasing from Amazon. Think before making bigger purchases.Update: Still unresolved and denied further supportAfter a week of back and forth, finally a replacement was created however it wasn't delivered. For 5 days straight, it kept saying ""Now arriving today"" and ""Rescheduled"" and it's just stuck there.After countless hours with ~15 support and escalation agents (they all have technical issues when I ask a question), one of them canceled the order in hurry and now they can't create a new replacement order. Asking me to return the defective phone and place a new order which is by paying 6500/- more whereas I placed the order on sale for 23.5k. One agent promised that he'll refund the new order but he disconnected the chat and the next agent is not respective that offer.Currently, I'm stuck with the defective phone and support team disconnected the chat even while talking and said we can't help you anymore. That Agent also sent an email with numerous links pushing the survey links to bottom and interestingly, he modified the survey URL's domain from Amazon.in to Amazon.co.uk to avoid feedback and this was by the either by the Escalations or Leadership team.Not just the frontline Support team, Escalations and Leadership teams are also irresponsible and have such unethical and unprofessional behavior. Not to mention, no one wants to check the previous chats, you have to repeat every single thing all over again and I've done this for 2 weeks with more than 15 Agents.Next: I'm taking this social media and consumer forums.

Very very IMP to read if you are planning to buy S20 FE 5G - Known display issue
","
Ever wondered why this model is also sold a large numbers which are refurbished? Thats because it has a display issue which are noticed within one month of purchase and if such phone arrives at service centre they replace them with another one with new phone if bought from offline store (if bought from amazon then they will repair only and you need to live with it). Then samsung repairs the faulty phone and sells as refurbished by the dealers. Otherwise such a latest model wouldnt have so many refurbished phones.Now below is my purchase experience.I bought this phone on 11th Aug 22 and on 19th Aug the display automatically stopped working. Since Amazon provides replacement for 7 days so I couldnt replace - I dont consider myself as unlucky because its the problem with most of the Samsung S20 FE 5G models, and if you go to Samsung customer review site you can see many customers complaining about it globally. Also if you visit Samsung Service Centre in India and just sit there for few hours then high chances 1-2 persons would come with this issue.I mailed to Samsung, Amazon and requested for replacement since it was a manufacturing issue but no one listened, I twitted but no help - just some usual response came from both Samsung and Amazon. Amazon said since 7 days passed so they cant help. Samsung said they dont replace online bought products although they have 14 days replacement policy but that is only for offline products.I was frustrated and raised greivance at consumer forum but there also Samsung said they cant replace the product since its purchased from Amazon. And after no help I asked Samsung Service Centre to repair the product to which they said they need to check if it was a physical damange or liquid damage etc. and they first scared me saying it looks like I messed with the product but later agreed when managed to convince them sitting the whole day in the service centre. now they are saying the screen isnt available or they are not able to order. I am holding the dead phone for almost a month now. If you are planning to buy this phone then consider yourself lucky and learn from my pathetic experience and just dont buy this phone. Better buy any other phone but not Samsung's.

A Phone with known screen black dead problem! Stay away from Samsung.
","
I bought this phone with high hopes, it worked fine for few days, but within 2 weeks screen went black. On checking the samsung forums and amazon reviews, I understood this is a known problem and there are many customers, probably almost everyone facing this same issue who got it online. Now probably its my turn to go to service centre. I am really surprised to see Samsung neglecting customers that too S series buyers. There are some cases where consumers have raised cases vs Samsung but no response. I sincerely request Amazon to stop selling such items with known issues, as they spoil your reputation. I know Samsung is a big giant, so was Micromax and Lava at one point. We trust Amazon on their reliability and quality, but such incidents spoil the whole experience. I already told my friend to buy offline and go for Oneplus as don't want him to face this challenge.One day Samsung will learn and pay for their ignorance towards customers like us. Now there are thousands who will never buy Samsung just because of their experience with S20 FE 5G. A sensible company will recall such products from consumers or provide them a permanent fix.I too pledge never to buy a Samsung mobile in future.Update: Visited the Service centre and they replaced the display and returned the mobile same day in few hours. I have not got extended warranty as am skeptical how long the display will last, so better to cover for 2 years. Post which we can say that investment was spent over.The only good thing is Service centre had spare display ready(probably anticipating all S20 users will visit at some point). The Person ahead of me was also visiting the centre with same issue of same model, so its evident that its mass batch issue. Ideally Samsung should recall and withdraw such products from market. Anyway probably Samsung know better what to be done, but my next mobile will never be Samsung.

Don't buy this model
","
Please do not buy samsung phones. I have bought Samsung S20 FE 5G phone before 20 days. My phone display has stopped working working now. I have seen many videos on your tube then I realized that it is common problem in this phone. Samsung service center is accepting it is manufacturing defect. However company is not ready to replace the phone. There are saying that only repair is possible. Which is  I ma fine with. All I want in return that send me confirmation on mail that same issue will not arise in future but they are not even ready to take guarantee for their own product. (THIS IS WHAT THIS BRAND IS). I have put my hard earn money on this phone.  I have visited service center for 6 time and have called in customer number many times yet there is not solution. Please if any one can guide me how to escalate this issue. It would be very much helpful.Updates. I am following up the company since last 25 days yet there is no solution from their end.I am have done so many research on it. It is manufacturing defect Samsung service center executive has told me that. I have all the proof. I am planning to file complain in court now. They are selling sub standard products. This my last Samsung phone which anyways I am not going to use it.  I will raise compensation demand in cash. Those who wants to file case. We can file a case in group as well. As we are facing same dead display problem (Display Blackout ). There are not just spoiling their image. Amazon has to look into this matter  as well. Please those wants to file case can join contact me on my email id girishpatel2433@gmail.com

Substandard product from samsung
","
I purchased it on 24 sep and on 23rd October morning after charging, the screen went blank(BSOD) and I cant use the mobile. 23 and 24 are service center holidays and on 25 th service center after taking around 1 hr time and opening my mobile confirmed that display is gone and needs to be replaced. Displays are out of stock and asked for 4-5 days time. Having no other option and as return window is closed by 1st October, i agreed . Still in warranty, hopefully the display replacement is free of cost. I met other guy with same issue same model and same one month usage.Seems this is a sub standard product from samsung. This is my first phone from samsung and used mobiles starting from Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, One Plus..this is my first visit to any mobile service center in the last 20 years or so. Totally disappointed with samsung.Just hoping the replaced display will come longer.Huge discount on this model in sale , may be I should have not fallen. Bye bye samsung after this phone.Update:I got mobile back on 29th Oct and display was replaced free of cost as it was under warranty. But lost all my Data(which was informed) and had to setup again from scratch.Just hoping this will not happen again even after warranty.Pretty sure this is my last mobile from samsung. Bye bye.Update2:Iam seeing lot of reviews where in many mentioning its issue with Amazon purchased mobiles only, NO, I met 2 guys when Iam in service center and both had purchased from the same store where service center is located. So its issue with Samsung doesnt matter it is store purchase or Amazon.

Screen black out issue within 15 min of delivery.
","
I got the order on 27th evening. I opened the package inserted the sim and started the phone while selecting the wifi option the screen went black. Phone was having 58% charge it is vibrating or making sound if I try to charge it.Imediately contacted customer care they said technician will come and see what is the issue. and they will proceed for the exchange. If any one went through this please let me know what solution did you got from this ?Now waiting for the Technician. I will update how this process goes..Day 2.Appointmnet for technician was fixed after 2 days.slot was 10 am to 2 pm. got a text message from amazon that I will be there till 10.30am.but thechinical guy did not show up. tried calling CC they assured they will arange it till 2pm but it was not done they have booked other slot after 2 days again.Now waiting for the next day.  I will update what the day unfolds on that day.Amazon Policy : ( As described by amazon customer care )1. They can only replace or refund ( whatever option available ) when the techincal guy give there report  to the amazon.  And there have been many cases where technical guy have submited a wrong report to amazon at last  customer suffers in this case.2. Amazon dose not have any control over the techincal service.  They can't find out where the technical person is they can't contact them they even can't communicate  with them. I don't know how amazon approve this kind of Important service on which they dont have  any control.

Phone Screen went dead in 10 days after purchase!
","
Please do your research about the phone before you buy this phone.I bought this phone from Amazon during the Dussehra Sale Offer and I was quite happy with the Amazon fast delivery. But after 10 days of use, one morning the phone screen went blank n dead.  The phone was working as i could hear the incoming call ringtone and also the phone vibrate but mobile screen was blackout.So immediately I took the phone to the nearest Samsung service center and told them the issue. Initially they said don't worry sir since it's just 10 days from activation Samsung has complete product return n replacement policy. But then when I said it's bought from Amazon they said sorry sir in that case we just have only the warranty coverage and no complete replacement applicable! Also, when I was in the service center seeing my samsung s20 fe box fellow customers who also had similar problem called out to me asking ""oh! same issue ah!"". There were 2 customers with similar issue (phone screen blackout in few days from purchase) on that day.I feel something is not right about the Samsung s20 fe 5G as a complete product. Maybe some QA check's were comprised before the product market release. If it's just one-off instance of similar issue we can ignore and say like 1 in 100 issue can happen but that's not the case here. I asked the Samsung CC person how many such issues reported, she said with a smile, yeah quite a few similar customer issues reported!

Black screen of death
","
Bought this during one of the sales for a decent amount of discount. But within a month of buying this phone the screen stopped working. It just went blank while I was browsing. I thought the phone shut down and kept trying to turn it on. But it wasn't responding. So I started removing the sim to put in a different phone and the phone made a sound as soon as the tray popped out, that's when I realised the phone is on but the screen had shut off.After some googling I found that this is fairly common for Samsung phones. It's been happening for many years and Samsung hasn't bothered to fix it. If only I had known this before buying the phone...This had even happened to my father's phone some 5 or so years ago. But it started back up after the phone battery discharged completely a day later, and didn't have a problem after that so brushed it off as a one off issue and didn't really look into it too much. Wasn't as lucky with this phone, will be going to a Samsung service center soon, lets see how that goes.Wanted to buy Samsung foldables in the future, but hesitant of Samsung phones in general now. Especially since this is a fairly frequent issue and they haven't bothered to fix it after so many years. And foldables have their own screen issues as well.Until this issue cropped up I was fairly happy with this phone. I would have given it 4.5 stars. One point that did bother me a bit was the weight. This thing is heavier and bulkier in hand than the M52 that my father has, despite having a smaller battery. I guess it is the better cameras and a metal frame addibg some weight. Premium touches no doubt, but the M52 is a bit more comfortable to hold in the hand and it has a marginally bigger screen and battery.  Anyway not a big deal, it was a good phone overall.

The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Just in 2 days after delivery
","
The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Phone was delivered on 02/10/22 and stopped working on 04/10/22. Phone screen gose completely black out suddenly while using. And now not starting. I tried to replace this via Amazon app but the option is not available their the only option is to get the technician visit and the slot is not available for technicain visit. After calling the Amazon customer care i got appointment for 07/10/22.I am editing this review today on 14/10/22 now my phone is replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Amazon and their customer support team. Now my phone is working fine.But i have one doubt if i i have got the new phone or not. The box was sealed but when I opened their was some dirt stick on the phone. As the phone screen guard was their. Also the charging adaptor was not properly at its place.  It seem that in transit these was displaced. But generally this dose not happen. As the package is made in such a way to avoid these displacementI want to ask Samsung and Amazone if they are supplying phone with screen guard applyed on Galaxy S20FE 5G. And durt on the screen guard. Is it standerd from Samsung. I think definitely not. Request Amazone and Samsung to clearify this. I have a doubt the phone i got is refurbished. I request Samsung to clearify my doubt by checking the sl no. And IMIE no. In their records.

FE means Fool's Edition
","
Screen - So-called Samsung's AMOLED is hype. It took me a lot of time to adjust to this screen because the colors are inaccurate.I'm using vivid mode with the white balance slider turned all the way to the right, i.e. warm.120Hz is a gimmick on this phone. You are forced to use it because 60Hz is unrealistically laggy. Compared to the aged Pixel 2XL, this phone is in no way faster by any means.Moreover, the refresh rate is not adaptive, therefore, battery drain is horrible.Speakers - Average, lack natural bass. The overall sound is on the sharper side.Battery - Poor. Don't trust screen on time. You have to charge it twice a day. I don't know what kind of a person is ""mild"" in this day and age.Performance - Software is poorly optimized. Performance is not good. It doesn't feel like a flagship.No headphone jack, but that's okay, nobody likes music anymore.Expandable storage - This is the only pro, everything else is a con. They removed this one too in S21 FE.Camera - Why do people say colors are subjective? Who purposefully likes unnatural oversaturated greens of foliage, exaggerated reds, and blues which look like they are painted on with a double brush?The overall photo is childish and basic. Compared to the Google Pixel 2, this camera is crap.And the camera app lags like crazy. It takes irritatingly long to get into the camera app, for it to be ready for clicking a shot.Ultrawide cameras are all gimmicks, so much more especially in this phone.Telephoto lacks resolution.The video quality is decent.The fingerprint sensor is horrible. Painful, really painful. You will curse it.Software - Thankfully no ads but miles away from the stock experience. Even though it has 865 SD, it feels like a middle-range phone. No, the software is NOT snappy. There are no glaring lags either but just not what you would expect. Or perhaps my expectations from a Samsung phone are unreasonable. Updates ain't so fast either. Samsung treats FE models as an afterthought.Bottom line - Don't buy this phone even if it sells for a single rupee above 30K. I made a mistake. Look elsewhere, don't be fooled by a ""near-flagship"" experience because there is none.

Samsung Fan, Good Phone, SCREEN BLACKOUT,  Great Camera
","
I have brought this phone on august 2022 on sale for 28600, That was a great deal for this phone and I have never seen this phone in this price range. I feel heating issue at first 2 days of use  while charging, streaming Youtube and playing games(BGMI). But after software update it seems fine and doesn't have that much heating issue any more. overall the phone looks good, camera is great and a descent battery life (1 day life with streaming + browsing + call ), finger print scanner is ok not that best in market. Battery wont be enough if you are a gamer.The real issue came after 3 months of use, one day the SCREEN got BLACKED OUT while using message app. I m a Samsung fan and I have been using Samsung phone's for around 15 year. This is the first time I m facing such an issue( only freezing issue found in previous phones ), it can be restarted but screen will be blacked out after a while. and it got fixed by SCREEN REPLACEMENT from service center. And the ISSUE is there for more users who PURCHASED on SALE DAY, some people already logged this in Samsung community. Only because of this I'm giving this phone a 2 star review.

Very disappointed product from Samsung
","
Very very disappointed, I never expected this kind of product from Samsung.Within 20 days (accurately after 17days of usage), the phone suddenly showed a black screen even though vibration and other things were working in the background. The black screen was not resolved even after trying hard booting many times. Since it was more than 14 days Service center team member told me that it can't be replaced but can be repaired.After an initial investigation, it was communicated that it is a defective piece. The screen and battery needed to be replaced. The estimated service time was 1 day.The next day when I enquired, they told me that the parts are not yet arrived and it will take 2 more days, Hoping that there will be no further delay.I never faced this kind of problem with Xiaomi phones before, I think I made the wrong decision to switch to Samsung phones. It has caused so much trouble as I am not able to authenticate my authentication on some of the cloud portals due to this issue.The only good point which made to buy this phone was the camera quality,  But what is the use of having a good camera when the phone itself is very unstable and has a black screen issue?

Shocking poor build quality
","
Bought in Jun 2022, delivered on 25th Jun, I find this hardware button to be broken/disassociated on Nov 5, 2022. Lucky for me, the part got lodged in my pocket and I could put a cello-tape and sort of fix it (jugaad). However, this has convinced me to not go with Samsung products anymore. The quality is deteriorating. BTW, the phone never fell from my hand, had a protector almost immediately. Now of course, Samsung will claim I (or my kids, or somebody else) MUST have dropped it. I have spent too much of time setting this up, and I can't give it to anybody without a huge inconvenience.Photo taken on iPhone bought in Feb 2021, (for context), fell twice till now, also has protectors, going strong.

Not a good deal

It's been one month since I got trapped.1. Battery life is average. It takes a lot of time to get fully charged. If u use the phone while charging, it will take more than 5hrs for fully charged2. Back camera is very nice, but selfie camera is waste. U can't make quality reels and u will look like chudel in video calling. No flash for selfie camera in this price range.3. Touch is just ok.4. Phone is a bit heavy.5. Not worth for 30k at all. Think twice before you buy this 🤔.Note - I listed it on OLX already

With this price go with one plus

The price at which you are getting this phone...... you cab go with one plus either....one plus has good battery backup with fast charging support... even after spending 30k on Samsung we are not getting fast charging support...it only offers 25w that too you have to buy adapter separately.The seller has taken away too much time to deliver as well... no issue with product recevied the product in best condition.

I brought this mobile few days before Dusara festival as I had my old MI mobile and wanted a new one. Thought to buy Samsung as it is very popular one and went for this Samsung Galaxy 20 FE. Used it for 2-3 weeks very carefully as it was new mobile and wanted to keep it safe till Diwali at least :). I had my personal data and office apps on it. 2 days back i kept it near me and was doing office work. had to call my colleague for urgent work in the weekend and this mobile stopped display and had to suffer a lot as i had my office app, contact numbers etc and even UPI apps on it.now i am unable to return it from AMAZON website. Need to call Samsung customer care...don't know how is the support from Samsung. I would suggest not to go for this model.

Extremely disappointed with the Battery
","
The phone is great in many aspects; I purchased it even after reading about its average battery life, but I’m highly disappointed after 1 week of usage even after starting with low expectations.I charged my iPhone 12 and Samsung S20fe to 100% last night and left them on my desk when I slept; this morning when I woke up, the iPhone is still at 100% whereas Samsung is at 92% (after 8 hrs of no usage)On normal days (with screen on time of 2-3 hrs) the battery doesn’t even last till the evening, and this is despite 60hz refresh rate and turning off several battery consuming features like NFC, nearby device scanning, location, Auto app updates, several personalisation features. I checked in the setting and it says 3% was used by google play services, 1% WhatsApp and % Samsung store. I’ve set all of these apps on the most minimalist modes, and yet have this battery drain.Regret buying this phone. Feels like Samsung and Amazon sold me lemon by discounting it heavily

Camera is best, display is great but in Samsung OS most of the apps are not working due to modified OS. Second point is, it is really over priced. I don't know why this phone is too costly as there is nothing new in this phone as compared to all other Samsung phones in the price 10K to 30K

Wondering if it's a flagship!

This doesn't come with 25w charger and headsets out of box for such premium price.You have to buy it manually.Usb C to 3.5 jack adapter from samsung only works, if you like to use existing headset, so that's an additional purchase.If you're buying in 2022, you may get android update in Mar 2023 and security update till 2024.Observing heating issue while charging with regular 15w charger.Hope this helps!

Not really a flagship

In call sound is so loud. It's irritating. Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use headphones/headsets/earbuds,etc.  everytime while speaking. Or if you can use loudspeaker..And remember they have aped Apple hence no 3.5mm jack slot. Either Bluetooth or wired headset with type c cable.

Reviewing after 2 months of usage as my Primary device..
","
This is totally my personal opinion about the phone, there are too many aspects to talk about and it will definitely help you with your buying...1. Look and build: (8 out of 10)  Firstly it is a good-looking phone for me, simple and sober, with a metallic frame the phone feels good on the hands too, back made of plastic and not too prone to scratches, even I dropped it a couple of times but it is fine as of now. So the plastic build is a key for those who don't use covers. but you must regret not having a 3.5mm jack.2. DIsplay: (7 out of 10) To be honest display is good but not as good as other Samsung flagship, I was using it along with the Samsung S9 and Realme X2pro side by side on 1080p resolution but the s9 and X2pro look more sharp and bright as compared, Pixel density and brightness nits are satisfactory but not issue in outdoors. overall the display looks good.3. Performace:(7 out of 10) It is the key part for me, with regular day-to-day tasks, multitasking app switching everything is fine unless it comes to gaming. the device comes with SD865 and on paper, it is a very good  SOC for performance and for gaming also, but Samsung doing it very wrong in the part of gaming, I m daily driver Bgmi player and I play it a lot, in the term of gaming performance it works really poor as compared to my Realme X2pro with SD 855plus. with the smooth extreme setting, there are high Visible frame drops and stutters. frames drop as low as 40-35 fps as compared to X2pro which continues to maintain 55-60 fps. Samsung does not work well on gaming optimization. So as my view who looks for a good gaming phone go for Realme Oneplus or other but if gaming is not that matter then definitely go for this.4. Camera:(9 out of 10) It is another key point for me, the camera performance on this phone looks excellent, I am fond of photography and for me, the camera works really well on color balance dynamic range, etc. wide-angle camera and portrait mode is excellent and the sensor works really good on low light conditions. the primary sensor OIS works really well but Video mode with the wide-angle lens is missing. Samsung must add it with updates. Overall the camera is really good.5. Battery: (8 out of 10)4500 mah is kind of enough for a mid-user. it typically lasts for a day most of the time. Battery management and optimization are good. But for the heavy users with heavy app load and background load the phone needs to charge more than one time a day.6. multimedia:(9 out of 10) Videos and movie watching experience is fun on this as the volume is loud and the Dolby sound and stereo effect works really well.7.UI:(8 out of 10) Samsung One UI looks clean and good but comes with lots of preinstalled bloatware ( some of them are uninstallable ) and adds( can be disabled while device setup or from the settings) and Android 11 and Samsung Nox security is a key part of this phone as the device comes with hardware base extra layer of security. and Samsung is good at pushing regular security updates and 3 years platform update. and it makes the device future-proof.8. Network reception:(9 out of 10) I am using airtel as primary sim. there is not carrier aggregation in my area. but devices support it also it supports Vowifi and dual-band WIFI so no issue with the network reception.I brought it for 41k with an extra 7k discount. and it kind of value of money for me because of the Brand name. and it is a really good phone from Samsung. but in this price segment, and there are lots of other options to look for.

Bought this for Rs 26500 and worth every penny
","
Even though this phone was launched 2 years back but 865 processor is still worth Rs 26500. The Camera is just amazing! other mid-rangers like M52 , A52s etc. are not even close.The battery is decent but since my usage includes normal day-to-day functions - WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome,5-10 photo clicks and some paytm types app and I set the refresh rate to 60Hz, I am able to use it for 2 days easily on single charge. The phone comes by default with screen guard which is not tempered glass but does provide some protection. The back cover is glasstic and needs some protection, Either the phone cover is such that or best is to get a film protection for its back as well just like screen.Overall Battery is 8.5/10(For normal usage where 60Hz refresh rate is also fine)Camera is 10/10, front Camera  =  9/10Performance for normal user = 10/10(Not sure about gamers)In-Hand Feel is perfect= 9/10Screen Quality  = 10/10

Very Smooth phone

DisPlay- 5 star.Processor- 5 Star-5G Ready powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Octa-Core processor.Battery- 3.5 Star-Speaker- 5 star.Fingerprint-3.5 star.Camera-5 star.Design- 5 star.Build quality- 5 star.Display:The display has a Super Amoled Panel. It has a fast refresh rate of 120hz. The colors are saturated as usual in a Super Amoled panel. The display is very bright as well. It is very smooth.UI:Packed of features. There is no doubt that Samsung is one of the best UI out there for Android.Battery:The phone has 4500mah. Easily lasts a day. Could last even longer if used in 60hz. The phone supports upto 25w charging. It also supports reverse charging. It even supports reverse wireless charging!!Performance: A top of the line processor by Samsung. Would've been better if the indian version had gotten the Snapdragon 865 chipset. But the 5g Version does have SD 865 but it is much more costlier.Camera:The camera sure is 12MP but it takes much more details than expected by a 12MP camera. It is a very capable capable unit under bright environments. But you can see lots of noise in dark environments.Finaly.Cons:1. Battery drains fast.2. It supports 25W charging but comes with 15W charger.3. Little Heating problem.Pros:1. Fully water proof.(IP68 Rated).2. Powerful Processor.3. Camera is super good.

Amazon screwed up delivery for the first time. I cancelled and ordered again after a week availing exchange offer. Plus, got discount on using a certain credi card. For 25k, this is a fantastic phone. The camera is outstanding. I have a DSLR and can confidently say that this pictures from this phone are as good as that, quality wise. Thanks to 8GB RAM, the phone functions smoothly. The screen resolution is top notch. I read a lot of complaints on screen conking off after few days. It's been 10 days since I have been using the phone. Thankfully, no issues for me yet. Hoping for the best 😄 The phone charges very quickly and battery life is very good for a moderate user like me who doesn't watch too many videos or okays games. Overall a fantastic phone at this price range. Go for it 👍👍

S20 FE 5g is very good product. I like the look and feel . Its real nice. Network connectivity is excellent. I get good 4G plus network.  5g is still not launched in my city. So can't talk about 5g. Bettery optimisation is very good. And nothing to say more about the software experience.  Its Samsung One UI. Just Great , no lag , no bug . I find it like this. So finally it a very good product by Samsung.

Best Midrange mobile at 30k
","
Bought this for 30k (In prime sale + Bank offers and No COST EMI).Screen: Absolutely stunning, it supports 60Hz and 120Hz. It doesn't switch automatically between these settings, you need to select it from settings.Rear Camera: Really nice, seriously good. Not just good enough.Front camera - A bit disappointed, it's good but not as good as rear camera.Performance - You can play games like Call of duty or BGMI at Max graphics settings that the game supports. It heats up a bit after playing for a hour. Which is absolutely normal considering it has Snapdragon 865 and as saying goes with great processors comes a little bit of heatings. Just know that it's normal, don't expect any mobile to not heatup while charging or doing heavy works. That's universal.Finger Print reader - Good, no complains. Won't feel any significant delay or issues.Charger - It comes with 15W USB type C charger and it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to fully charge the battery. Mobile however supports upto 25W charger and it also supports wireless charging which I haven't tested. Don't buy a separate 25W charger for this, because the 25W charger takes only 10 minutes less than 15W charger to fully charge it.Sim cards - Supports 2 5G sim cards and upto 1TB (confirm this) expandable storage. However the slot is hybrid, it means you can't use both sim cards and external memory card at once. Either use both sim cards or 1 Sim card and external memory card.I don't think you will need external memory card because it has 128GB internal storage which is enough for normal users.It comes with Android 12 and Samsung one UI 4.1 and will support updates upto Android 13.It doesn't have headphone jack.Box contains - Mobile, Charger and Charger cable. Sim ejector.Amazon usually have discount (without prime sale), so don't buy without any discounts.As of August 2022, Expect it around 30k to 33k. Don't buy above this price because it randomly comes down to this price on some days.Personal suggestion: buy a cover ASAP. I droped it next morning and fortunately nothing broke, got a scratch around camera bump. Camera bump is made of glass-ish stuff and it can break very easily. So just keep that in mind.

Received defective phone and running from one customer care to another to replace the phone
","
Below is the experience so far.1. Received a defective product. Battery was getting drained out in few hours, wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble,  including Google maps. (Location was not getting captured)2. Tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app I open. (tried on 7th night as well, but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile - Amazon app was in this phone. Used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile)3. Amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6. First visit to center, they did a software update (3 week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending) and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. Faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. Second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn't allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they don't have the authority for that.10. Called customer care number again, and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the seller.So back to step 3. Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , If I manage to reach there.Update :11. All customer care said they can't replace the phone. So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. Again, whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again.12. I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist (battery was draining out by the minute). I showed it to them. They told me it's a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. They also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. Used for 2 days. Same situation. No improvement.13. Went back to them again. They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience.17. I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. They refused with all their might and said ""phone is working now"". During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. I officially registered a complaint. But still no luck of returning the phone.Update on Nov 30th.18. I was traveling and outside the country. On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70% charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980's. Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times. No luck. Still grid lines. My flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip.19. Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. (Nov 30th.) Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. They mentioned ""patch issue. Software update dint happen"" . At this point, I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. No 3 month old phone's screen will stop responding because of software update missing. They are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.

Worst phone money can buy.

It was an awful GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL'22 for me. I bundle ordered this phone along with a pathetic mattress from Wakefit. The mattress got cancelled 3 days after scheduled delivery, and this phone does not even work.4 hours into using it, I was on a phone call and suddenly it makes a lot of noise that goes away on speaker mode only to return upon turning the speaker OFF. While still continuing with the speaker mode, the call was dropped. After repeated attempts to place the call I realized SIM 1 is not recognized. I turned off and reinserted a different SIM, and it still read NO SIM 1. There is this obnoxious heating part which I discounted in the initial few hours, but it only got worse in that limited time this phone worked.Soon it started going insane, restarting every few seconds and I was tired after a long day at work. I just dropped it on my study table to go to sleep and whole night it gave a DJ lighting effect while turning ON and OFF all on its own!This is not even the worst, I contacted Amazon; a TECHNICAL EXPERT says she couldn't initiate a return/refund on this product. She rechecked only to say not possible. She can only exchange the phone that too after a diagnosis by their expert who will visit me 3 days later! Like I said in the first paragraph, I reminded her off my mattress that was cancelled from their end. She feels so SORRY about it, but wont accept return. That's rich! They are okay with seller cancelling the delivery without informing the customer, that too after making the customer wait for 11 days. But they won't accept a return on an insane piece of crap that they call M53.I asked her to transfer the call to the team that will answer about my mattress and she did. This guy seems sensible and accepted the return in few minutes of explaining the issue. He promptly arranged for the return pick-up next day. This was the Amazon India I have known for years, but now! I returned the phone after a lot of effort and currently waiting for the refund as I type this.To try a non-Chinese midrange phone I have gone for this, but now I wouldn't dare to buy a Samsung phone again.

Samsung is a joke!! Never purchase a samsung phone again

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the recently purchased product which is the Samsung M53 5G. I am really disappointed with the phone and the service centre. I have faced plenty of problems.Let me explain problems in the detail. I purchased a cell phone on 16th May 2022. It worked well for a couple of days. As I continued to use it, I found faults in the handset. Firstly, it played random noise at random times at any point in time. Thus, to fix it I went to the service centre. I explained everything to the service centre. They said that the latest software update would fix the problem so they took their time and updated the software. After a couple of days, new issue raised. i.e., the screen of the phone blacked out automatically. Nothing seemed to work when the screen was off. This was really frustrating.I don’t understand how the new phone within 15 days of purchase can work like a faulty piece? I chose this phone over Apple and OnePlus after considering all the factors and it seems to be the wrong choice for me after all. The surprising thing is when I asked the centre to replace the phone as it was creating a lot of problems and I can’t every time leave my office to fix the issues they denied and said we could do it if it is within 14 days from the date of purchase. However, it was 15 days so they did not do it. I really think this is a ridiculous way of taking care of customers.My phone is in WARRANTY (ONLY BEEN 15 DAYS)!Never purchase samsung phone!! Terrible experienceA REALLY FRUSTRATED CUSTOMER!!

Avoid Samsung

Samsung low range, mid range(upto 50k) mobile phone just sell only for brand & our mind is set for non Chinese brand, other wise Samsung make most third class phone in this price brand,A. No very good build quality (cheap type plstic & paint) B. Always use low quality processor (exenyos or or low end midiatek)C. Always use Samsung sensor for camera in this range, i have 20mp old dual camera HONOR phone, much much better than 108mp(only for show)D. Its amoled skin is only good part but that time he use below 400ppi & lower brightness (not proper show in sunlight)E. In few months lag also comingD. Only 25w charging speed,Now new technic no charger in tbe box,No screen guard applied, no back cover, no 3.5mm converter jack in the box. (local converter not work properly, only original Samsung converter will work, which price almost 800rs..now not available in Samsung store)This brand only running for our government support.. Nothing else..In this price range or below u get much much good quality phone in the market..My old phone was almost 4 years but camera is much better than & performance, display also very good.Samsung midrange just waist of the money..

Samasung's high priority Bug
","
This phone has lots of cons that still need to be upgraded. The price range should be 16000 to 20000 only.Battery is average ( was draining fast even when not in use ), Fingerprint is slow, Display is somehow good.The most bug that I detected from samsung is that there's a call sound problem ( both on loud as well as ear ) from the day of purchase.When I was calling someone else, call sound was high, I tried to down call volume on both Loudspeaker and ear speaker, but that remained same i.e. high. The call sound is not getting down, I restarted phone but still same issue. Second issue was with mic, The other person on call could not hear my voice ( with focus mode On/Off ) properly. Every time my voice was so less to the receiver, so had to talk loudly.Both these two issues were resolved automatically after 2 days ( don't know how ) for a short time. Then again faced.Thought that it maybe occurred with some phone's setting, therefore I called customer care from samsung. He said that you've to call Amazon customer care ( the product you purchased from ).So I called to amazon customer care and told the issue, they checked and offered me to return the phone.I returned this product.Also I had purchased Samsung Galaxy M32 5G about 9 months ago. After 7 days of software update in current month the same above mentioned problem I'm facing. However this problem was resolved temporarily when I rebooted but after 1 day again the same issue.This is so high glitch on samsung that disappointed me.I gave one star rating.

Gone for a Samsung phone after using MI n Oppo for last 7yrs and the experience is worst.My previous Oppo k1 is still much better than this phone which I thought I am upgrading.- Battery backup is not that good- Phone performance is not upto the mark, response time is lagging, doesn't feel like 6gb ram- Camera quality definitely doesn't justify the price- Automatic brightness is fully responsive- Contacts getting deleted automatically- Call settings got changed automatically twice.Only one good thing that justify the price and brand name is the display but if u need an overall good phone. Pls go for MI, Oppo, Vivo.No customer service after so many complains and tweets ..no one is bothering to call alsoWorst Exp - This is my last gadget of Samsung

 I was planning not to go for samsung M53 initially but previously I was using galaxy f41 which was quite fine especially the battery life. Thought I can now trust samsung blindly after that. Not knowing I will be sorry for that. First of all they removed the adapter from the box and selling it separately before that they used to troll Apple for removing adapter from the box. But the real problem was when I bought the original samsung adapter for the same it was working fine for 10-12 days but after that it was not charging M53 but charging other phones, I thought my phone has some issue but to my surprise when I plug into other charger it was charging the real irony was it was not charging the phone for which it was bought for. Not only this this phone has serious battery drain issue, i always put on battery saver yet it hardly last for a day. Hanging is also there and when the battery completely drains you have to put it for 4-5 hours of charging. I don't care about the camera.

The product was delivered on 21st Novemeber'22. From the 23rd, mobile data, WiFi and Bluetooth stopped working completely. When I searched for the solution online, several others reported the same issues with no solution. Store-based sellers are not offering the model and its service for the same problems.

This phone is like Arrange marriage. you will get this phone online only that means you can not see it before you buy.The phone is a collection of extremely cheap parts. Samsung does not give the charger and that is OK as they told it upfront. But the cable sent with the phone is so bad that below the metro station a 60 rupees cable is better than what is hipped by Amazon.neither  front and rear the camera are upto the mark. The performance is also too slow. Do not misguide yourself by fancy specifications.The speaker are also very  normal and similar to the phone 8000 which you can not hear even when you are alone in room...I can challenge if the voice is clear and loud than my iphone5.All you can do after buying this Samsung phone is write a review on Amazon which neither Samsung not Amazon will bother. So my recommendation is do not play blind with these Online only models and better  buy what you see. Once you see what you like buy it from anywhereyou can google ""Samsung phone restart problem"". You can find yourself how people are victim of Samsung online only

I used this device only for last 3 Days and based on it my feedback is1. WIFI - Very unstable and frequently  getting  disconnected  even my other device is connected  with same wifi.2. If I disabled  my WiFi and  trying to enable it again, It doesn't  enable  again and I need to reboot  my device3. SIM slot is not good, my micro SIM which get fit perfectly  does not fit in Samsung  M53 5G SIM slot and I have to push it to fit.4. Device  operation  based on 8Gb RAM is not upto mark when compared  with 8GB OPPO similar configuration device.Overall very average for me Samsung Galaxy M53 5G experience.

Battery sucks

M52 4g is better than this. As I have to charge it two times. Only camera quality is good. About 5g it is not launched in Pune's all areas. And 4g is enough to do your all activities. Don't buy it only for the sake of 5g. If you check 5g speed in spedtest it will consume 1gb of data only to check speed. So it's better to use 4g if you want to save data. I am mising my M52 for battery.

Hello everyone ,anyone who is planning to buy this phone please don't, the 108mp camera quality is very poor ,the performance is not upto mark ,oot platforms like hotstar doesn't work on it ,it got stuck many times while using ....please don't waste your money.....go for other brands in the same range oneplus or realme....

The phone is incompatible with BSNL sim. Samsung and Amazon should display this in the product profile. Sometimes, BSNL is the only service provider in your area and you cannot change it to any other service provider. Unaware people purchasing this phone feels cheated.

Not worth of money

After long time I have decided to move from non-Chinese Mobile and I purchased Samsung M53. after buying this product I realized that this product is not having the basic functionality which I have been using since 2017. Can’t disconnect call by power button. Vibration when call connected and disconnected. Internet speed throughput Screenshot by Three finger moving on screen. Touch is not good. Some time multiple time has do move finger to receive call.Etc.

okay but not happy
","
phone okay, but not happy with (1) no audio jack port (2) no USB cable.The description says data cable, but both ends of the cable is C-type. This is good only for a phone to phone to connect. Not sure why phone to phone connection is mandatory as part of a phone purchase but a charging cable is not provided. One way, companies advocate to use an original adaptor and charging cable, but they instead provide only phone-to-phone connecting data transfer cable, which lets the users buy generic adaptors/charging cables. Samsung would have given a USB cable instead of a data transfer cable.And also, no Audio jack. The only option now is to go for a Bluetooth headset. I'm not a fan of Bluetooth headsets, but no option left now.

 You can not know in this phone what is ur data speed, camra is good but few times Awakword Stuation as it recads all the spots in photo so rateher being Beutified photo u will get small darks and spots on ur face. I am sharing 7th day of my new m53 mobile video and find it is hanging. Here auto data mobile data from one sim to other is not found working in my phone, sim one data overe other have to manually change. Battry back is disappointing, in my new mobile purchase 100% charge mobile worked 1/2day only. Due to C to C cable we can't connect it with laptop or computer. No having adopoter is disappointing.But it have many good things also that is attractive. It have some bad things but still I recommend because having other good Feacheurs.

I am a loyal Samsung mobile user. it's been years, haven't used any other mobile except Samsung ones.To start with it has a sleek body, look and feel of a high end smart phoneDisplay is the best thing.Cam with 108 mega pix - super quality pics.Same selfie cam but so many features, I like the object eraser feature a lot. as if you have a photoshop program inbuilt in your mobile itself.rest all is at par.Con : No provision for audio card input, you have to use wireless headphones!So sleek and delicate that you need to be careful all the time.Overall : Loved it ! am writing it after using for more than 4 months. no complaints at all.

Don't buy Samsung Products.  They are not providing Charging Adapter.  There adapters are costly starting from 1300. (Oppo, Vivo Original Adapters starts from Rs.500). Adapters Quality is very bad.  My previous adapter is not working Samsung is not providing new as I lost my Adapter Box.  But I have the bill and it is under warranty but due to no Box they are not giving me the Adapter.

Bad to worst experience
","
First let me give a review of the mobile. I bought 8 and 128gb version. Overall is good. But it says it's fast charging but to charge it from 20% to 100% it's taking more than 2 hours. And with moderate use the battery will last for 30 odd hours, including the night time when we are not using it atall. Got the product on 30th October. After using for 2days suddenly the display was not working properly and after 10-15minutes it went totally blank. Now nothing is visible. Display totally gone.Tried to raise a replacement but as per Amazon a technical person will visit and check, and after his report they will proceed further. Ok, no issues with this, but the slot they gave is after 5days. They are delevering your product in 1day after you have ordered, but if there is any issue , them they are taking more than a week to replace it. That's not acceptable. Let's see what happens after the technician visit. Will provide the next updateGot the new phone after 10days. It was a very very bad experience while returning the product. Technician was scheduled after 3 days i raised request but no one showed up, got no calls from them. No one picked my call. I was told to reschedule it. I did for a time slot of 10 AM to 2PM (again after 48hours). Again no one came. I called to amazon customer and they told me to again reschedule. I dropped 3 mails escalating it. Then the techinicain called me and came after 6PM.I finally got the phone replaced on 10th November.The camera is not as good as it shoud be. Battery is bad. It takes more than 2.5 hours to full charge and stays for just over a day. (I dont play games on phone)

Conned by Samsung and AMAZON
","
The worst phone I've ever purchased!1.Battery: very poor, battery drains quickly and takes 2.5 hours to fully charge a phone in idle mode. False commitment of fast changing and useless 5000mah battery!2.The phone keeps getting hang, if using 3-4 apps simultaneously.3. The Camera is worse! Front cam is 3rd class. You have a better camera in M31 Samsung, which is cheaper than this.I had bought this phone on 13th sept 21, and had raised a replacement on 20th sept on this app, and chose 22nd as a date for technician visit. (I was given an option by amazon app from 21st to 25th).The technician didn't visit on 22nd and I called customer service dept to check about it. They informe that replacement window had already past on 21st, then I asked why was I given an option by this app for a technical visit on 22nd? Then he raised the same concern with his managet and said I'll be getting a reply soon.I didn't get any response, so I contacted the customer service dept again today, the higher dept to which this issue was raised has resolved it without informing and is not willing to talk to me.They have considered this phone fit without  physically verifying, and are not willing to communicate the application glitch which allowed me to book a technician visit which was on the next day of the last replacement day.Very good amazon! Thank you for this experience. This will be the last time I will be ordering an electronic item from you.

NO SL. NO. & IMEI NO. MENTIONED WITH THE INVOICE
","
The phone is not that best, but it is good. No issue with the Phone yet. But The problem is with the Seller & Amazon.And I feel this problem happens with every, different phones, selling by Amazon or the Seller.After delivery of this M32 5G phone, I didn't get any physical Invoice inside the delivery box. So I downloaded the invoice from Amazon app. After downloading it, I don't get the Serial no. & IMEI no. mentioned on the invoice, like how the offline shops mention every details about the phone on invoice .So, the problem is, whenever I visit service center for any service related to this phone, and the service center ask me to show the invoice for claiming warranty benifits.But, if the IMEI no. & Serial no. not mentioned on the invoice, then how the service center indentify that the invoice is registered for the same product.Problem from Amazon-After understanding the problem, immediately I contacted Amazon Customer Care by 06/11/2021. Then I explained all the issues to the customer care executive. So the executive asked me to provide all the images of IMEI no. & Serial No. mentioned on the mobile and box,  image of Amazon Delivery Box & the images of  invoice, pay slip.Then the customer care executive confirmed all the documents and raised a TT. Then told me to wait for 10 days, so, I'll get a new invoice with the IMEI & Serial no.After 9 days I contacted again. Then I got to know that, there's some error because of one image was not cleared. So, again I had to raise a new TT with new required documents and again have to wait for 10 days excluding holidays.They didn't even notify me about this error. If I didn't contact again, then I never got to know about this issue.So, If I am getting these much problem from  online Store. Then it's good to purchase from any offline store.And also asking to all the buyers to check with your invoices with any mobile phone you purchased online.

Problem phone quality

It's exactly 8 months since I bought this phone - It's showed up problems in audio- I couldn't hear caller or caller couldn't hear me. Around 30th August 2022, just 8 months after purchase, it stopped working completely, and I had to take it to the Samsung service center who told me the software update had corrupted my phone. I couldn't make or receive calls. My phone was reset and I had to reinstall all my apps. There is something drastically wrong either with the software or hardware (today it is 1st September 2022 and my phone is not working again). Please do not buy this phone - System UI stops responding, calls cannot be received or made, and apps crash.

Writing after 1 week.Major problems -1. fast battery discharge during internet browsing and doesn't last for 10 hours in the new phone.2. Over Heating problem during the online video (from youtube Facebook tweeter etc.) plays on 4G network.3. Does not support OTG USB storage device. Always promot to format your 3TB external hard disk. Do not buy, if you want to use external storage device via OTG adapter. Visited service center, but no success.Display is just ok with bigger screen size.Camera is ok.Phone is bulky but looking nice and sturdy.Sound is amazingly loud and clean without headphone.Fingerprint is very sensitive and sometimes irrigating too when it unlocks mistakenly. LoL.Overall a good phone to buy if you focus on technical configuration and security of data with Knox.Hopefully, next software update will fix the overheating problem and quick battery drainage.I will update the review after a while again.

I have purchased this product in the Amazon sale and had it delivered on 15th Oct 2021. So far these are my observations -1. The phone has amazing battery life2. Never heats up3. Calls are clearly audible4. Apps load fast5. Body looks and feels durableDislikes:1. Samsung, please understand my dog collar is longer than the USB cord. Suppose I am in a railway station and want to charge my phone from a plug point 4ft up without a dock, should I stand and hold the phone till 15W charges charges the device? What's with the short power cord?2. Screen in reading mode flickers. This is visible from day one. I am not initiating the return only because the device seems to hold up without malfunctioning. But in reading more, that flicker very much is visible.3. This is for buyers. If you're a camera person, straightaway skip this device. It has basic camera settings which was common 5 years ago. no aperture settings, shots look bland4. Is it too much to ask for a free screen guard with the phone that's charged a premium just for 5G bandwidth? Xiaomi is doing it and so are others5. Lower the cost as soon as possible. This phone is not worth 17000. I would put it in the ballpark of 12000-150006. Slowest and probably clumsiest face unlock - slow, lethargic, and not accurate. Probably because the camera isn't great

I bought a 8GB+128GB version. This 5000MAH battery is a useless one.On first day the phone was unplugged at 100% recharge at 7PM Saturday & battery drained to 25% by 11.30AM on sunday. The Battery Save mode was ON all the time. No calls made & most of the time the phone was lying in idle. Just 5 hours of light browsing was made.Again today unplugged by 5AM & by 4.30PM the battery drained to 48% with 3hrs of browsing usage, no calls made & kept idle most of the time.Yet another unreliable heavily speculated product from samsung india 💩🤯👎.My 5 year old Moto G5S+ 3000MAH battery is doing the same job after all these time of heavy use 👏👏 Kudos Motorola.Imagine what the gamers could use this useless phone of meger battery life.The so called 15W Fast charger is outdated & bulky, an useless accesorie. It takes 3 hours to full charge this handset. 🐢😤🤬If customers have the chance to get refund for this product as per 7 days replacement policy then undoubtedly everyone will choose that option & get rid of this sxxt phone.Most of the time the screen response is also cheap. So diificult or even non-responsive to copy OTP or other messages from the screen.

My first phone was a ZTE foldable CDMA since I opted for Tata Indicom. I loved it as it had so many features not available in the GSM phone that my friends had. When it stopped working, can you believe, I got a Huawei which was not so good but I used it for a year. Then I got a Samsung Wideo which accepted a CDMA SIM. Just loved it. Was heavy, bulky and odd but it made an impression whenever I used it. It was replaced by a candy bar Samsung. Both the device were replaced since the battery died. By this time CDMA handsets were rare the only one that accepted a CDMA SIM was the Honor Holly 3 Plus. It was okay. It accepted calls but CDMA data could not be activated. I replaced it with the Honor 9 Lite which was superb. Dropped it a couple of times but it still works. But it was time for a replacement. No Honor phone was available neither online nor on the shops. So I decided to buy from a brand I know. I had high hopes on this phone but it just wasn't as good as the Honor 9 Lite.

I just loved this phone using it now for about 20-25 days. Ordered it the same day of it’s launch and the best part received my phone within 24 hours . Qualities which are winning my heart are :1. It’s premium look give more class to the phone2. It’s a perfect size phone with 16.55 cm huge screen and still it’s a light weight phone very convenient to carry.3. Battery back up is amazing . It gives 24 hours or even more performance with wifi which is amazing .4. It’s quad camera setup gives you best pictures and again quality is just amazing .5. Selfie camera gives you perfect selfie which is 13MP.6. Lock censors work superb .7. Sound quality is amazing and very soothing to ears .8. Quality of screen is amazing.9. Performance is also great .10. Samsung has given all the premium feature in this range with perfect storage space.My reason for choosing this phone was it’s 5g 12 band network support but with this i got all the premium features. I am super happy with my choice . Thanks Samsung.

Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range.

I should have sticked to Redmi or Vivo. I often remove my Sim and use it from my wife's vivo phone, her phone works well.

Bad to worst experience
","
First let me give a review of the mobile. I bought 8 and 128gb version. Overall is good. But it says it's fast charging but to charge it from 20% to 100% it's taking more than 2 hours. And with moderate use the battery will last for 30 odd hours, including the night time when we are not using it atall. Got the product on 30th October. After using for 2days suddenly the display was not working properly and after 10-15minutes it went totally blank. Now nothing is visible. Display totally gone.Tried to raise a replacement but as per Amazon a technical person will visit and check, and after his report they will proceed further. Ok, no issues with this, but the slot they gave is after 5days. They are delevering your product in 1day after you have ordered, but if there is any issue , them they are taking more than a week to replace it. That's not acceptable. Let's see what happens after the technician visit. Will provide the next updateGot the new phone after 10days. It was a very very bad experience while returning the product. Technician was scheduled after 3 days i raised request but no one showed up, got no calls from them. No one picked my call. I was told to reschedule it. I did for a time slot of 10 AM to 2PM (again after 48hours). Again no one came. I called to amazon customer and they told me to again reschedule. I dropped 3 mails escalating it. Then the techinicain called me and came after 6PM.I finally got the phone replaced on 10th November.The camera is not as good as it shoud be. Battery is bad. It takes more than 2.5 hours to full charge and stays for just over a day. (I dont play games on phone)

This is  worst phone ever I bought from Samsung. Battery is dead within 6 months of purchase.  Spending 20,000 approx for 6 months is a costly affair.  That means 3000/month from your pocket for 6 months for mobile phone only. I request not to buy Samsung mobile at all

Worst experience with the new phone not charging and no replacement
","
Battery is not charging and no professional behaviour from the Amazon

Conned by Samsung and AMAZON
","
The worst phone I've ever purchased!1.Battery: very poor, battery drains quickly and takes 2.5 hours to fully charge a phone in idle mode. False commitment of fast changing and useless 5000mah battery!2.The phone keeps getting hang, if using 3-4 apps simultaneously.3. The Camera is worse! Front cam is 3rd class. You have a better camera in M31 Samsung, which is cheaper than this.I had bought this phone on 13th sept 21, and had raised a replacement on 20th sept on this app, and chose 22nd as a date for technician visit. (I was given an option by amazon app from 21st to 25th).The technician didn't visit on 22nd and I called customer service dept to check about it. They informe that replacement window had already past on 21st, then I asked why was I given an option by this app for a technical visit on 22nd? Then he raised the same concern with his managet and said I'll be getting a reply soon.I didn't get any response, so I contacted the customer service dept again today, the higher dept to which this issue was raised has resolved it without informing and is not willing to talk to me.They have considered this phone fit without  physically verifying, and are not willing to communicate the application glitch which allowed me to book a technician visit which was on the next day of the last replacement day.Very good amazon! Thank you for this experience. This will be the last time I will be ordering an electronic item from you.

NO SL. NO. & IMEI NO. MENTIONED WITH THE INVOICE
","
The phone is not that best, but it is good. No issue with the Phone yet. But The problem is with the Seller & Amazon.And I feel this problem happens with every, different phones, selling by Amazon or the Seller.After delivery of this M32 5G phone, I didn't get any physical Invoice inside the delivery box. So I downloaded the invoice from Amazon app. After downloading it, I don't get the Serial no. & IMEI no. mentioned on the invoice, like how the offline shops mention every details about the phone on invoice .So, the problem is, whenever I visit service center for any service related to this phone, and the service center ask me to show the invoice for claiming warranty benifits.But, if the IMEI no. & Serial no. not mentioned on the invoice, then how the service center indentify that the invoice is registered for the same product.Problem from Amazon-After understanding the problem, immediately I contacted Amazon Customer Care by 06/11/2021. Then I explained all the issues to the customer care executive. So the executive asked me to provide all the images of IMEI no. & Serial No. mentioned on the mobile and box,  image of Amazon Delivery Box & the images of  invoice, pay slip.Then the customer care executive confirmed all the documents and raised a TT. Then told me to wait for 10 days, so, I'll get a new invoice with the IMEI & Serial no.After 9 days I contacted again. Then I got to know that, there's some error because of one image was not cleared. So, again I had to raise a new TT with new required documents and again have to wait for 10 days excluding holidays.They didn't even notify me about this error. If I didn't contact again, then I never got to know about this issue.So, If I am getting these much problem from  online Store. Then it's good to purchase from any offline store.And also asking to all the buyers to check with your invoices with any mobile phone you purchased online.

Problem phone quality

It's exactly 8 months since I bought this phone - It's showed up problems in audio- I couldn't hear caller or caller couldn't hear me. Around 30th August 2022, just 8 months after purchase, it stopped working completely, and I had to take it to the Samsung service center who told me the software update had corrupted my phone. I couldn't make or receive calls. My phone was reset and I had to reinstall all my apps. There is something drastically wrong either with the software or hardware (today it is 1st September 2022 and my phone is not working again). Please do not buy this phone - System UI stops responding, calls cannot be received or made, and apps crash.

This phone tft screen. Hence always on display not there & phone screen will not turn on by it self when you receive notifications. It will only play sound. In built speaker little loud but not good at all. Display quality dam low. Battery back up is not up to the mark. Charging speed also slow. So over all this phone not even worth 14000rs. Being an Samsung user always never seen any worst product of Samsung than this. I am full regretting. So now its your choice. Phone is heby & thikness is there. So dont buy.

Writing after 1 week.Major problems -1. fast battery discharge during internet browsing and doesn't last for 10 hours in the new phone.2. Over Heating problem during the online video (from youtube Facebook tweeter etc.) plays on 4G network.3. Does not support OTG USB storage device. Always promot to format your 3TB external hard disk. Do not buy, if you want to use external storage device via OTG adapter. Visited service center, but no success.Display is just ok with bigger screen size.Camera is ok.Phone is bulky but looking nice and sturdy.Sound is amazingly loud and clean without headphone.Fingerprint is very sensitive and sometimes irrigating too when it unlocks mistakenly. LoL.Overall a good phone to buy if you focus on technical configuration and security of data with Knox.Hopefully, next software update will fix the overheating problem and quick battery drainage.I will update the review after a while again.

I have purchased this product in the Amazon sale and had it delivered on 15th Oct 2021. So far these are my observations -1. The phone has amazing battery life2. Never heats up3. Calls are clearly audible4. Apps load fast5. Body looks and feels durableDislikes:1. Samsung, please understand my dog collar is longer than the USB cord. Suppose I am in a railway station and want to charge my phone from a plug point 4ft up without a dock, should I stand and hold the phone till 15W charges charges the device? What's with the short power cord?2. Screen in reading mode flickers. This is visible from day one. I am not initiating the return only because the device seems to hold up without malfunctioning. But in reading more, that flicker very much is visible.3. This is for buyers. If you're a camera person, straightaway skip this device. It has basic camera settings which was common 5 years ago. no aperture settings, shots look bland4. Is it too much to ask for a free screen guard with the phone that's charged a premium just for 5G bandwidth? Xiaomi is doing it and so are others5. Lower the cost as soon as possible. This phone is not worth 17000. I would put it in the ballpark of 12000-150006. Slowest and probably clumsiest face unlock - slow, lethargic, and not accurate. Probably because the camera isn't great

An another Disappointing product from Samsung.

I bought a 8GB+128GB version. This 5000MAH battery is a useless one.On first day the phone was unplugged at 100% recharge at 7PM Saturday & battery drained to 25% by 11.30AM on sunday. The Battery Save mode was ON all the time. No calls made & most of the time the phone was lying in idle. Just 5 hours of light browsing was made.Again today unplugged by 5AM & by 4.30PM the battery drained to 48% with 3hrs of browsing usage, no calls made & kept idle most of the time.Yet another unreliable heavily speculated product from samsung india 💩🤯👎.My 5 year old Moto G5S+ 3000MAH battery is doing the same job after all these time of heavy use 👏👏 Kudos Motorola.Imagine what the gamers could use this useless phone of meger battery life.The so called 15W Fast charger is outdated & bulky, an useless accesorie. It takes 3 hours to full charge this handset. 🐢😤🤬If customers have the chance to get refund for this product as per 7 days replacement policy then undoubtedly everyone will choose that option & get rid of this sxxt phone.Most of the time the screen response is also cheap. So diificult or even non-responsive to copy OTP or other messages from the screen.

My first phone was a ZTE foldable CDMA since I opted for Tata Indicom. I loved it as it had so many features not available in the GSM phone that my friends had. When it stopped working, can you believe, I got a Huawei which was not so good but I used it for a year. Then I got a Samsung Wideo which accepted a CDMA SIM. Just loved it. Was heavy, bulky and odd but it made an impression whenever I used it. It was replaced by a candy bar Samsung. Both the device were replaced since the battery died. By this time CDMA handsets were rare the only one that accepted a CDMA SIM was the Honor Holly 3 Plus. It was okay. It accepted calls but CDMA data could not be activated. I replaced it with the Honor 9 Lite which was superb. Dropped it a couple of times but it still works. But it was time for a replacement. No Honor phone was available neither online nor on the shops. So I decided to buy from a brand I know. I had high hopes on this phone but it just wasn't as good as the Honor 9 Lite.

The phone hangs some times and takes more time while using an app. Some background apps consuming battery. Getting heated while charging. yesterday while charging it got heated and there appeared cracks on the  front glass at camera, left upper corner and  right lower corner. Don't  understand what to do.

Samsung M32 5G '3 rating' for performance not for camera

I give rating based on my experience.- I like the performance of this device which is very fast from my previous mobile- Not much satisfy with the display which have an TFT which experience like holding 10k budget mobile display experience as using previously AMoled Gorrilla Display which is far better then this one.- Dual aap feature have it but not have flexibily like 'Mi Mix 2' have like you can split / dual app apps to configure 2 accounts within single mobile- Charging not fast as i think or describe in the product description via online- Camera Quality not good and just put 48 MP tag onto box to get customer/buyerOverall experience I can say it ok worth for those looking device for performance wise not camera perspective.

Totally I had worst experience with this 5G set, I really want to return this as soon as possible. This is totally like my nightmares and Impacting on my work.The above stated review was written when I received phone and earlier experience. After several months and regular software updates, phone working good. But I guess initially they pro.itwd without without any updates later they sending notifications to update it well in ti.ely manner. But still I can't see it as 5G set don't k ow the reason and camera also not good and not supporting other camera apps too.

I just loved this phone using it now for about 20-25 days. Ordered it the same day of it’s launch and the best part received my phone within 24 hours . Qualities which are winning my heart are :1. It’s premium look give more class to the phone2. It’s a perfect size phone with 16.55 cm huge screen and still it’s a light weight phone very convenient to carry.3. Battery back up is amazing . It gives 24 hours or even more performance with wifi which is amazing .4. It’s quad camera setup gives you best pictures and again quality is just amazing .5. Selfie camera gives you perfect selfie which is 13MP.6. Lock censors work superb .7. Sound quality is amazing and very soothing to ears .8. Quality of screen is amazing.9. Performance is also great .10. Samsung has given all the premium feature in this range with perfect storage space.My reason for choosing this phone was it’s 5g 12 band network support but with this i got all the premium features. I am super happy with my choice . Thanks Samsung.

Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range.

There are many hidden problems in this phone.
","
This phone is overpriced for even discounted price (12,999/- for 6 GB variant). I purchased it because of past good experience with Samsung (Galaxy On6) but this phone cannot match the legacy. Samsung has done too much  unnecessary cost cutting on this phone.Camera: It has an average camera. It clicks decent photos and records good videos up to 4K 30fps, fhd 60. Only the main 50 MP sensor is usable, all others are present just for count. Camera has serious bug that it captures washed out colours if its AI detects a human face while using flash. If we remove human from frame, it captures just fine colours. Also, colours are just fine while clicking without flash.Front camera is pathetic from today's standard, it will just get you with video calls and nothing more, do not expect to use it for selfies with clarity. I do not click many pictures so I am okay with its camera.You can see this issue in the attached images, both the images were captured in low light with flash, the first one came out fine with colours close to actual object while the second one has completely washed out colours because the AI in phone detected human there. This unnecessary processing ruins the joy and there is no option in camera settings to turn this off. I have spent many hours trying to avoid this with different combinations of camera settings but it cannot be turned off. This bug might be embedded deep in the phone hardware as even third party camera apps ( I tried with OpenCamera) also give the same results.Battery : It can last for around 2 days with light to medium usage. It struggles to last one full day with high usage. Exynos 1280 is not efficient considering it is 5nm chipset. Also, the phone gets warm even with normal usage ( browsing etc) and gets somewhat hot during gaming.Idle battery drain is around 8-10% per night.It charges from 8% to 100% in 4:50 hours with 5 watt charger.With 7.5w (5v 1.5a) charger, it takes around 2:55 hours.Charges in around 2:15 hours with 15 watt charger (shows as fast charging).With 25 watt charger, the phone shows as super fast charging and charges from 5% to 100% in 1:24 hours.Display : Display seems smooth with 120 Hz, obviously not punchy as super amoled but it is okay and has good brightness for sunlight use and sufficiently low brightness for comfortable night use. Viewing angles are good. I did not face any issue with display and am okay with it.Buggy Auto brightness: Samsung has a habit of using cheap virtual sensors on its devices. This phone has virtual light sensors which is just a software solution to set screen brightness according to light present in room and using front camera as the light source. But this is seriously buggy in this phone, the phone does not understand difference between complete dark and dimly lit room. So, it will apply same brightness settings to both of these situations resulting unnecessarily bright screen in dark and uncomfortably dim screen in dimly lighted room. This sensor works poorly in outdoor as well. Most of the time, the brightness it applies to screen is not adequate.Software and UI: Samsung had installed may bloatware apps which are removable, One UI as everyone knows, is pretty user friendly. So, that is okay, however, Samsung should mention that this phone does not support some of the features such as S secure, bixby routines and sound assistant which are useful for some. Otherwise software experience is good, lag free.WiFi: It supports 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi at 1x1. So max of 72 mbps in 2.4 ghz mode and max 433 mbps in 5 ghz mode. This is the most basic wifi configuration possible. It can share wifi over hotspot which is nice. Although basic, wifi will not give any issue and has good range. So, wifi is okay.Bluetooth: I did not test bluetooth range but found it sufficient for my use. It can connect to two different  devices simultaneously. However, can play music in one device only. Did not find any issue with bluetooth.Mobile network: It has good 5g support with 12 bands but supports only 1 5g sim at a time. If we set one of the sims to 5g mode, the other one drops to 4g/3g/2g mode.It supports carrier aggregation and when tested, it was working with 3 band carrier aggregation with Jio.Call clarity is good and it can record calls without announcing to other person. virtual proximity sensor is not too bad.Fingerprint reader: For this price, the performance of side mounted fingerprint reader is good enough.We can register up to 3 fingerprints only which is limiting and not appreciated, at least 5 should be given.Face unlock: I guess it has AI based face unlock which works good even in low light condition. Although I do not know how secure it is.Storage and Memory: It has 6 to 8 GB of Lpddr4x RAM which is good for this price.128 GB storage used is UFS 2.1 which is not justified at this price in 2022 and lacks in performance when compared to UFS 2.2, apps take more time to install.Gaming: I installed call of duty mobile and it allowed settings up to medium graphics with very high frame rate and low graphics with max frame rate. In both settings, game was lag free and frame rate was always below 60 fps. So below average gaming. However, I do not play games, so, did not test with other games and do not care about gaming performance.Multimedia: Display quality is okay and single bottom firing speaker is average and audio from headset jack is fine, no complaints here.The chipset used in this phone supports h.264, h.265 video codecs only and does not support VP9 and AV1 codecs which is the most annoying downside. This means that it can play youtube only till 1080p and not in 2k or 4k because youtube supports h.264 up to 1080p only and we need vp9 and av1 support if we want to play higher resolution videos and if in future youtube removes h.264 support then this phone will not be able to play youtube at all. This is a very serious issue with this device. In future, all the streaming services will eventually switch to vp9 and av1 codecs as they provide better streaming efficiency and are royalty free, but as this phone does not support those, we cannot say this will be good for multimedia in future. So, 0 points for this in multimedia.Also, if we play youtube videos in browser like brave, it runs in software acceleration mode ( again, due to lack of vp9 and av1 capability) which loads up cpu and drains battery fast. Use youtube in either Youtube app or Newpipe to prevent unnecessary battery drain (as these apps play videos with hardware acceleration, which saves power). All this nonsense applies to other OTT apps (Hotstar, Prime etc) as well as almost all of them use VP9 codec for streaming which this phone plays in software mode, which shoot up the cpu usage and causes fast battery drain ( around 15-18% per hour).GPS and navigation : Works just fine. Has compass support.Pros:Two promised android updates and 4 years of security updates.Sufficiently good display with high refresh rate, feels really smooth.Good audio, WiFi and Bluetooth.dedicated memory card slot.base variant with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage which is good.Cons:Samsung cheaping out with no charger/cover/screen protector in box while competitors provide those.5g on single sim only. Competitors provide dual 5g in even cheaper phones.inferior UFS 2.1 storage is not good at this price, UFS 2.2 should be there.only up to 3 fingerprints.Buggy camera algorithm.cheap virtual proximity sensor.buggy camera light sensor.Exynos 1280 chipset claims to be having 5nm lithography which is good on paper, but in reality, its efficiency is on par with some 12-14 nm chipset and it heats under general use. Also, I don't understand why Samsung had to omit useful VP9 and AV1 codec which wouldn't even have costed them more as they are royalty free and Mediatek Dimensity 920 with same Mali G68 GPU supports those codecs. This has resulted the phone to be not able to play 4K and 2K resolutions on youtube.No HDR playback support.

Worst possible phone at this price segment
","
Please see screenshots.Storage: Storage speed test in Antutu seems to get score of 28000. When I asked customer chat in Samsung portal, they said it is EMMC 5.1.Battery: is 5830 mAh, not exactly 6000 mAh. Better not to cheat customers by marketing a 5830 mAh battery as 6000 mAh. Instead, give an actual 6000 mAh battery.Display: seems okay, but has some dark borders at all edges of display. Borders are thicker than other phones.Camera: at low light does not identify objects well.Overall, Samsung should work on giving more value at same price by providing either UFS 2.1/3.1 storage or amoled display.Battery life: doesn't come 2 days with moderate usage. Exynos processors need to efficient not only in terms of nanometers, but also in software-hardware optimization, which seems to be lacking.Will add updates if I find any after few weeks.Edit on 23 April 2022: Light sensor is not working correctly and quickly, and proximity sensor is working very slowly. Display is not visible under sunlight.Edit on 2 May 2022: Added more screenshots. Light sensor is not identified. One of the apps shows EMMC 5.1 as storage type. Feeling my money got wasted.Edit on 13 May 2022: Touch response and phone response both are slow due to EMMC 5.1 storage. At least they could have given UFS 2.1 for INR 15,999. Both 50 MP and front 8 MP cameras have the worst clarity and quality. Please refrain from buying this device. Too many compromises are done in this phone.Edit on 20 May 2022: There have been many fake reviews seen, probably to improve the rating and feedback. Do a comprehensive and deep research before deciding to buy. This phone is not at all recommended with the worst hardware configuration - No charger, worst cameras and proximity, light sensors.

Few drops of water makes you regret
","
So I bought this phone recently and while travelling on a bike few drops of rain might have entered the bag in which this phone was kept and next day screen started to act weird. There is not a micro level of water protection in the phone. The samsung store charged a hefty sum for the screen change and I still regret my decision to buy this phone, lured by good specs on the screen where the basic things are a miss.

Messaging, payment apps, office applications do not work
","
Hello everyone,I bought this phone because my previous phone completely broke.But been having problems with payment apps and office apps.Upon digging/Googling I understood that it is because messaging doesn't work on M series phones. We cannot save the messaging centre manually,  and it is probably a bug.I tried calling Samsung Customer,  I am hoping I will get a call back from them in a couple of hours and hopefully a fix.Truly truly disappointed, not what I expected from a 20000+ phone.Update:Got a callback next day from Samsung,  they want me to do a bunch of trouble shooting steps. If those don't work, I am to go to the nearest service centre.Please be wary before buying this phone.

Worst and laggy phone i ever used in my life. Also Samsung site got better rate than this
","
I made purchase then noticed 2k less on Samsung website. Anyway it’s my mistake so not returning it. Hope this will be fast one as it’s 6gb ram.After couple of days usage i am feeling bad on this purcgase. 6GB ram but i am not happy with speed of this. Skype too slow.4 cameras but its useless for taking photos of real use. If you just want to share it on social media then it looks awesome. But if i want to take a product photo and try to edit in photoshop its no where near to usable qualityAs its slow you definitely need tripod to get photos proper.Usage reviewIt's the worst phone i ever used and 6gb or 8gb ram is just a trap. It's useless as this phone is dead slow. If I click something i get something else. That kind of slow it is. Chinese brands with 2gb ram and below 8k budget got 100x speed  than this. To type this review it took me lot of time becaus it's issues.

Worst phone

My 4 year old Realme 1 is working much faster than this. Become worst just after android 13 upgrade. 6, 128 GB phone working like a 2, 16 GB phone. It's performance is worst may be due to exynose processor. I don't recommend. Better go for realme, redmi, OnePlus, iqoo etc.

Average performer
","
Recommended for house wives and mothers who use phone moderately (i mean, this phone is not good for heavy users).Reason for 2 star rating is that they didn't provide a charger and with the charger which i got separately outside, I'm facing slow charging speed and heating issues. Mobile company giants like samsung and apple are not providing chargers in the name of becoming ECO FRIENDLY, but doing this only adds to carbon footprint by these :1]new charger means new cover and new box for that charger2] additional new box and packaging material for shipping (@ online orders)3] additional fuel consumption by vehicles transporting the charger4]additional invoice means additional paper5] if the received piece is defective or not upto the mark, returns and replacements add more to all these.THIS BETTER STOP NOW.this new trend is as annoying as it's impracticality.If not for their charger feud, i would've given this 4-5 stars.PS: display is a drawback for this mobile but in the long run, you wouldn't notice any difference. So, i guess LCD display isn't much of a problem.

Call recording does not work when WIFI calling is enabled
","
I only bought Samsung for this particular feature ie, Call recording without the second party not getting to know I am recording the call. After the Android 11 release, every other phone company using Google dialer has to mandatory announce the call recording is in progress to comply with the GDPR laws of Europe. Only Samsung makes their dialers and does not use Google dialers by default, so they somehow circumvent this issue.But they did half-assed work.WIFI calling is an essential feature in the new phones. The network inside the homes is terrible in cities due to tower shortages. But when you enable the WIFI calling, this phone does not record, not manually nor automatically. Never knew this problem existed; even my old Oppo A31(android 9) has this call recording feature even if the WIFI calling is enabled. All Samsung phones, including this one, do not work. The Samsung forums have people complaining about this issue for the past two years, and still, there is no workaround from Samsung.I did not know about this problem. Otherwise, I would not have gone with this phone.Another issue, as everyone complained, is the missing adapter. It looks like Samsung wants to fool Indians by selling phones without adapters. I got fooled. It is going to give a bad reputation to Samsung. How good is a phone without an adapter? It's like buying a car without wheels.The phone is super heavy. It's not suitable for people with weak hands and muscular issues. Good as a hands-on weapon.Even though call recording has a severe shortcoming, the quality is good. It can be used as an everyday working phone with sufficient memory and storage.

Only for elderly people

Honest ReviewI bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly. Experience -1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.The voice focus function is good.5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.7. There are some really small good featureslike samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.No charger

 Fab phone...the display is not ambled but didn't bother me due to quality... it is super fast.  I bought the 8gb version. The look and back is stylish. It is light weight although not very slim from sides.The camera looks good with all the premium features like slo mo, portrait, macro, hyperlapse etc. The performance is super smooth. The new thing is side button finger print sensor. Easy to open. Face recognition is good. Rest will post after using some time. But in this cost, it looks super worth the money. Go for it!Edit:I am surprised why is everyone talking about charger.. we have n number of chargers floating in our houses from older phones and it is a good way of reducing e waste. Also, if they would give the charger and headset, the cost goes high. So may be Samsung can create it as an option for people who want to buy with extra cost. The features of the phones are premium, except Amoled display, but look at the cost.. I think it is a bargain.The phone is fantastic. I have been using since 3 days now, excellent battery backup- 2 days with normal usage (I don't play games), super smooth and fast, and 5g is awesome (use with wifi).Edit:Major audio bug that I am facing in this phone. I requested for a replacement and guess what the replacement phone has that issue too.As soon as I put an audio app to back ground...let's say I am listening a song or an ebook via headphone and I go to home screen, it creates a loud screach and very very loud voice. U will have to take off ur earphone.The biggest issue is the replacement didn't solve this problem. I would have to go to Samsung now. :(Don't buy. Not worth it. I was using M20 for 3 years before this and it was clearly better.

M33 5G THE UNDERDOG YOU WILL LOVE
","
Well i am writing the review after using this phone for nearly 10 days , we my experience is as follow1.OFFER HELP ME BUYINGi purchased this device in Rs 9400 in Amazon summer sale ( including all offers) refer image attached , So for me in this price range i think this is the best what i can get2. WHY  M33 5GWell This is my first Samsung device  in 10 years of using smartphone  & before buying there are lot of negative notion against this device  but as amount and offers are tempting so i decided to buy the device , BUT i can say there is lot of noticeable difference between this Samsung device and others from MI , POCCO'S & REAL ME (BEEFORE I HAVE REALME 6) well the difference are as follows2.1. the screen :- Lots of you tubers and electronic gurus told the screen is bad , etc. etc . but  as per my usage the screen is awesome not comparable to AMOLED but better than  all other group IPS panels , i like the 120 HZ scroll feature is great .2.2. Software:- In my home there are lots of MI, Realme devices and we all have one complaint in common that is bloatware, unwanted messages due to which whole phone experience go to waste coupled with Bugs in UI, So this time after buying Samsung M33 i get rid of lot of bloatware's and unwanted advertisement2.3 Built :- built is simple and solid , i like the Rugged built with Gorilla Glass 5 protection , Over all it is good2.4. Network Connectivity :- Samsung is  very old company in telecom  as compared to these new Age smart phone manufacturer, and believe me Samsung device are far far better in connectivity as compared to other my all old devices from chinsed manufacturer always struggle with network and connectivity issues  but this device is lot better if your prime aim is to communicate and do calls2.5. sound & speaker:- There is feature of clear sound in the phone ,which is good for long time calls & speaker is loud enough for You tube content consumption2.6. Knox security :- It is very good added advantage for secure online payment , as I am deal high on online payment then this feature have very required security for day to day money transfer2.7. Battery & Processor - Processor is snappy and highly responsive and combined with 6000mha battery due to this the device is long lasting hours of usageConclusion :- I am experienced  smartphone user and always emphasis that one should buy phone as per his  or her prime requirements and I found this Samsung device M33 a well balanced  smart phone and will recommend others to buy one because the There is no alternative to network connectivity and Knox security if we compared to other devicesTHANK YOU

In 10 min, there is no display on phone. Assuming low battery, we have connected for charging. After 1 hour also, no display on.Took it to service center. No damage identified on the outside. There is a signal link break between display and motherboard. I guess it is the wire bus.It does not come under warranty it seems. They claim that it must have happened because of phone fall on the backside. Boss ! ThERE is no FALL. No hint of damage on the external, buy I side online broke-- and no warranty!!!

BAD EXPERIENCEI would write not about product but my horrible experience,so that someone gets alarmed before u buy electronic items.High value items like this are non returnable. I didnt know the rule change. Accidentally my son ordered for my wife ,and just after i received the packet i thought to get a higher version phone. Didn't open the pack, hoping to return or get it replaced for another model.But to my horror, i found that Amazon has cleverly removed the return option. So I tried for a replacement, but i saw it can be replaced with same model. So even if,i didnt open the pack,i was forced to use it. It's a great lesson learnt.

The phone is good for average user and will not give any issue for about 2 years, 90 Hz ambled display, massive battery, decent camera, processor could have been better. Plus the offer for 3 months prime subscription is bogus, when I tried to redeem coupon it says already used. So overall I will give 3 out of 5 for overall offer from Samsung and Amazon.

Samsung with other processes (mediatech, sanp dragon) is better than Exynos. So if you are trying to this mobile for your parents is a better option. For gamer's it's not suggested. Simply buy this mobile who you only hello hello, what's app and to surf social media and news feeds.Camera is comfortable for normal users.I am getting two days of battery life on full charge with 5000mah battery.

Very poor product. Just forget about the Camera quality. A lot of noise and color variation you will find in the images taken out with this. Especially the front camera, a cheap webcam can take a much better image than this. Just see the noise, brightness issue and color variation in the shirt shown in the image(shirt is a very light colour one but it is coming entirely different in this image and no details of it). Camera is also very laggy in preview mode.Beware that this product once purchased can't be returned or replaced. Amazon will right away deny that mentioning about their policies. Think twice before buying this. In terms of other performance it is somewhat ok but not justifying the amount that we pay for. There are better alternatives available for 19k available from other manufacturers. Quality of the product is not at all justifiable from this price point.

Don't go with only the written specs and compare with cheaper fones, quality matters a lot! Trust me.On paper, it is inferior in specs as compared to other brands, and other samsung online-only phones, but This fone is far better in quality than any fone I have used so far. (I have almost always used mid range fones)Pros:1.Good battery life and outstanding stand-by battery ( u sleep at 60%, u get 60% wen u wake up)2. Reception Including Bluetooth is excellent.(I can use use my Bluetooth earphones from next house also! )3. Very premium feel and very smooth touch.4. I don't know how, but this tft display is much clearer and better than many amoled displays of the same range .5. 3yrs of android updates and 4yrs of software updates!6. Samsung charger In the box, u like the online only variants(though it's a 15w charger)Cons:1. Little overpriced maybe...1000to1500 rs, but it compensates for it in the luxury feel, tough built and gorilla5 glass.2. Takes longer to charge since it's upto 25w charging, but I charge the fone once in 2 days, coz it consumes very less power, even while playing gamesDon't listen to the so called you tubers tho are not the real experts on the matter. If you have been using Chinese fones like redmi/realmi/oppo etc then u will surely enjoy this fone , it's smoothness and the premium feel/looks.

Please , Don't buy this product ""samsung galaxy M13"" specially from Amazon.This product I have purchased from Amazon, I faced the problem  .....The mobile is being hanged continuously and after inserting the sim the network is not showing........This problem I have discussed with customer care and first of all I wanted to return this product and I wanted to take my refund back but the thing is what they started a process like to send the technician to delivery address and after that the technician called that and we told him to visit our address and he forced not to come on delivery address. According to technician he said he will resolved the issue on call.....one application we installed that he want for testing purpose after that he sent screen-shot on my personal mobile number in that he had selected hardware issue and said that now you can return the product. But the main thing is I am unable to return this because there is no option available for this ...I tried to call the technician again, he is not recieving my call....so called customer care again....... we talked with customer care and what they said we will send the technician again...but we want our refund back but they forced me to send the technician again and repeat the process again.....But why should I do this process again this is not our fault.....I want my refund back.This product I had purchased for my mother and I have faced this problem.I request you all please don't buy this mobile or any mobile from Amazon... You can all face the same problem as we have faced....In logo paiso ki koi kadar nahi he. Ek person mehnat krk paisa kamata he or ye logo haram ki khane ki padi he.Kl se inke kisi family member ko gift de rahe he or problem ho ink sath bhi....tb inko pta padega.Meri batdua he in sbko ink sath isse bhi worst hona chahiye.....inka paisa or kisi chiz me nikalna chahiye.IF YOU WANT TO THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT I RECOMMEND TO GO TO  THE GOOD MOBILE SHOP AND PURCHASE IT.....DON'T PUT YOURSELF IN THIS TRAP.Thank you

Not worth the hype and money - Samsung should look at the design quality of M13

I had to replace the phone since it was stopping while playing videos and the touch wasn't working. I got a replacement phone and it has the same problems though touch is slightly better. The video playing either won't stop even if you push back button or will keep stopping intermittently as if buffering even with a 100MBps wifi or mobile data. I had to repair by broken Redmi with no option left and it work wonders.I suggest people can skip this phone for a better one. Samsung should look at the design quality of M13

Bad display. Contacts app is very pathetic

Display is way way way pathetic and dull. No contrasts...gives a feel that oil is spilled over screen. Phone needs to be operated at very high brightness settings.If you have saved a contact without adding+91 which generally is the case... it's not showing the name of saved contact because you have not saved +91 in your contact details.This kind of problem I am facing for the first time in any phone.Even non smart phones worth rs 2000k will show the name of contact if the main 10 digits are correct.This phone is not displaying contact just because you have saved  0 in place of +91 or just saved the 10 digits....

Worst mobile

The samsung and Amazon both fooled people.This is the first time I have tried to return a mobile and had worst experience with Amazon.Key Issues with mobile: Quickly device getting hot. Very much irritated during calls Battery drainage quicklyWorst Amazon support When I reached the CS support, they asked me to wait for a technical agent visit.  But the assigned technical agent left Amazon for more than year and I ended up co-ordinating with  CS support and that person.Again the next person avoided a personal visit and put me on a Minspect app and verified for few min. (Worst app at all and they promised for a personal visit but ended up on-call check)Again after a new call to the support team, they have agreed for a refund and asked me to update my pan card. But Again a new CS person refused that policy 🙄 🤔I don't know whether the intention of CS support is yo solve customer query or to time pass with us to feel irritated

mediocre laggy device
","
I bought this for my dad who is currently using M21 1st edition. Let me list down pros and consPros:1. 6000 mah battery2. Branded device. Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.3. Charger included in box (15w)Cons:1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery3.  very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.

Device performance

battery life, fingerprint reader are good. But there is lot of noise while taking foto in low light condition.One must also look the performance of the device. For the price range it's ok but there is drop in performance and frame rate while scrolling through Google news and youtube. Not only these there are lots of lag while using. I have been using m13 4g for 7 days. If you want to buy then go for the M13 5g model which offer more fluidity since it runs on MT D700 (7nm technology) which is more better performance  the exynos 850. Think carefully while buying.

Please , Don't buy this product ""samsung galaxy M13"" specially from Amazon.This product I have purchased from Amazon, I faced the problem  .....The mobile is being hanged continuously and after inserting the sim the network is not showing........This problem I have discussed with customer care and first of all I wanted to return this product and I wanted to take my refund back but the thing is what they started a process like to send the technician to delivery address and after that the technician called that and we told him to visit our address and he forced not to come on delivery address. According to technician he said he will resolved the issue on call.....one application we installed that he want for testing purpose after that he sent screen-shot on my personal mobile number in that he had selected hardware issue and said that now you can return the product. But the main thing is I am unable to return this because there is no option available for this ...I tried to call the technician again, he is not recieving my call....so called customer care again....... we talked with customer care and what they said we will send the technician again...but we want our refund back but they forced me to send the technician again and repeat the process again.....But why should I do this process again this is not our fault.....I want my refund back.This product I had purchased for my mother and I have faced this problem.I request you all please don't buy this mobile or any mobile from Amazon... You can all face the same problem as we have faced....In logo paiso ki koi kadar nahi he. Ek person mehnat krk paisa kamata he or ye logo haram ki khane ki padi he.Kl se inke kisi family member ko gift de rahe he or problem ho ink sath bhi....tb inko pta padega.Meri batdua he in sbko ink sath isse bhi worst hona chahiye.....inka paisa or kisi chiz me nikalna chahiye.IF YOU WANT TO THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT I RECOMMEND TO GO TO  THE GOOD MOBILE SHOP AND PURCHASE IT.....DON'T PUT YOURSELF IN THIS TRAP.Thank you

DON'T BUY THIS PHONE
","
Bought it after seeing 4 star ratings and good! Reviews. But these days all these high ratings are fraud in India atleast. This phone is an example. Only two months after purchase display hangs and hangs and hangs despite deleting videos, apps and caches. This phone doesn't have screen mirroring facility.  Taking screenshots too could've been easier. Total disappointment and unworthy of money. DON'T PURCHASE.

I want this product for normal use.....But the Exynos processor is too slow unable to use the phone properly from day 1 ....I have to report an error to the care for the optimization of the phone.... But their reply is to run the Test.Hence, Facing the same problem even after run a test.

Not worth the hype and money - Samsung should look at the design quality of M13
","
I had to replace the phone since it was stopping while playing videos and the touch wasn't working. I got a replacement phone and it has the same problems though touch is slightly better. The video playing either won't stop even if you push back button or will keep stopping intermittently as if buffering even with a 100MBps wifi or mobile data. I had to repair by broken Redmi with no option left and it work wonders.I suggest people can skip this phone for a better one. Samsung should look at the design quality of M13

Bad display. Contacts app is very pathetic
","
Display is way way way pathetic and dull. No contrasts...gives a feel that oil is spilled over screen. Phone needs to be operated at very high brightness settings.If you have saved a contact without adding+91 which generally is the case... it's not showing the name of saved contact because you have not saved +91 in your contact details.This kind of problem I am facing for the first time in any phone.Even non smart phones worth rs 2000k will show the name of contact if the main 10 digits are correct.This phone is not displaying contact just because you have saved  0 in place of +91 or just saved the 10 digits....

Don't waste your money in this phone.

Don't waste your money on this phone. Forget about any app installation. Phone is not working with the pre-installed app. Even I have uninstalled few pre-installed app still phone hanged and not working as a normal phone. I have to restart multiple times for a normal operation. Phone is too slow to operate and full of junks. Phone got hanged if you open the settings. So don't waste your time and money on this phone.

Worst mobile
","
The samsung and Amazon both fooled people.This is the first time I have tried to return a mobile and had worst experience with Amazon.Key Issues with mobile: Quickly device getting hot. Very much irritated during calls Battery drainage quicklyWorst Amazon support When I reached the CS support, they asked me to wait for a technical agent visit.  But the assigned technical agent left Amazon for more than year and I ended up co-ordinating with  CS support and that person.Again the next person avoided a personal visit and put me on a Minspect app and verified for few min. (Worst app at all and they promised for a personal visit but ended up on-call check)Again after a new call to the support team, they have agreed for a refund and asked me to update my pan card. But Again a new CS person refused that policy 🙄 🤔I don't know whether the intention of CS support is yo solve customer query or to time pass with us to feel irritated

I like  Samsung  but  Samsung M13  5G Phone  is not Good. Every  thing is slow . apps  are not  work  smoothly. So I think  you should  not buy it.

mediocre laggy device
","
I bought this for my dad who is currently using M21 1st edition. Let me list down pros and consPros:1. 6000 mah battery2. Branded device. Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.3. Charger included in box (15w)Cons:1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery3.  very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.

Device performance

battery life, fingerprint reader are good. But there is lot of noise while taking foto in low light condition.One must also look the performance of the device. For the price range it's ok but there is drop in performance and frame rate while scrolling through Google news and youtube. Not only these there are lots of lag while using. I have been using m13 4g for 7 days. If you want to buy then go for the M13 5g model which offer more fluidity since it runs on MT D700 (7nm technology) which is more better performance  the exynos 850. Think carefully while buying.

Please , Don't buy this product ""samsung galaxy M13"" specially from Amazon.This product I have purchased from Amazon, I faced the problem  .....The mobile is being hanged continuously and after inserting the sim the network is not showing........This problem I have discussed with customer care and first of all I wanted to return this product and I wanted to take my refund back but the thing is what they started a process like to send the technician to delivery address and after that the technician called that and we told him to visit our address and he forced not to come on delivery address. According to technician he said he will resolved the issue on call.....one application we installed that he want for testing purpose after that he sent screen-shot on my personal mobile number in that he had selected hardware issue and said that now you can return the product. But the main thing is I am unable to return this because there is no option available for this ...I tried to call the technician again, he is not recieving my call....so called customer care again....... we talked with customer care and what they said we will send the technician again...but we want our refund back but they forced me to send the technician again and repeat the process again.....But why should I do this process again this is not our fault.....I want my refund back.This product I had purchased for my mother and I have faced this problem.I request you all please don't buy this mobile or any mobile from Amazon... You can all face the same problem as we have faced....In logo paiso ki koi kadar nahi he.

DON'T BUY THIS PHONE

Bought it after seeing 4 star ratings and good! Reviews. But these days all these high ratings are fraud in India atleast. This phone is an example. Only two months after purchase display hangs and hangs and hangs despite deleting videos, apps and caches. This phone doesn't have screen mirroring facility.  Taking screenshots too could've been easier. Total disappointment and unworthy of money. DON'T PURCHASE.

Not worth the hype and money - Samsung should look at the design quality of M13
","
I had to replace the phone since it was stopping while playing videos and the touch wasn't working. I got a replacement phone and it has the same problems though touch is slightly better. The video playing either won't stop even if you push back button or will keep stopping intermittently as if buffering even with a 100MBps wifi or mobile data. I had to repair by broken Redmi with no option left and it work wonders.I suggest people can skip this phone for a better one. Samsung should look at the design quality of M13

Bad display. Contacts app is very pathetic
","
Display is way way way pathetic and dull. No contrasts...gives a feel that oil is spilled over screen. Phone needs to be operated at very high brightness settings.If you have saved a contact without adding+91 which generally is the case... it's not showing the name of saved contact because you have not saved +91 in your contact details.This kind of problem I am facing for the first time in any phone.Even non smart phones worth rs 2000k will show the name of contact if the main 10 digits are correct.This phone is not displaying contact just because you have saved  0 in place of +91 or just saved the 10 digits....

Worst mobile
","
The samsung and Amazon both fooled people.This is the first time I have tried to return a mobile and had worst experience with Amazon.Key Issues with mobile: Quickly device getting hot. Very much irritated during calls Battery drainage quicklyWorst Amazon support When I reached the CS support, they asked me to wait for a technical agent visit.  But the assigned technical agent left Amazon for more than year and I ended up co-ordinating with  CS support and that person.Again the next person avoided a personal visit and put me on a Minspect app and verified for few min. (Worst app at all and they promised for a personal visit but ended up on-call check)Again after a new call to the support team, they have agreed for a refund and asked me to update my pan card. But Again a new CS person refused that policy 🙄 🤔I don't know whether the intention of CS support is yo solve customer query or to time pass with us to feel irritated

mediocre laggy device
","
I bought this for my dad who is currently using M21 1st edition. Let me list down pros and consPros:1. 6000 mah battery2. Branded device. Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.3. Charger included in box (15w)Cons:1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery3.  very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.

Device performance

battery life, fingerprint reader are good. But there is lot of noise while taking foto in low light condition.One must also look the performance of the device. For the price range it's ok but there is drop in performance and frame rate while scrolling through Google news and youtube. Not only these there are lots of lag while using. I have been using m13 4g for 7 days. If you want to buy then go for the M13 5g model which offer more fluidity since it runs on MT D700 (7nm technology) which is more better performance  the exynos 850. Think carefully while buying.

WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT
","
Purchase this or anything on Amazon at your own risk, customer support is not going to help.My unit had a physical defect, gaps on the sides from the back panel and it's a serious issue considering the phone is ip68 rated (water resistant) and this gap can cause water damage. Poor quality control as I saw some other customers reporting same issue and some units also getting water damage and then Samsung can't help there.First, they can't replace directly now. Some technician will visit and verify the issue however no one called or showed up and then I get an email saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Support Reps on chat are disconnecting the chat saying they can't do anything, there's a different team for these issues which is rude. It's been more than 24 hours and no one joined that chat and yet I was told ""I have option to keep this chat window open so have you can get connect with your concern team""Lastly, cherry on top is that they CAN'T change the address for the Technician's visit even if you're not at the same location where the order was delivered. Due to this, I had to wait 4 hours on a different location for the Technician's visit and no one came except for the email later saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Basically, you're on own after purchasing from Amazon. Think before making bigger purchases.Update: Still unresolved and denied further supportAfter a week of back and forth, finally a replacement was created however it wasn't delivered. For 5 days straight, it kept saying ""Now arriving today"" and ""Rescheduled"" and it's just stuck there.After countless hours with ~15 support and escalation agents (they all have technical issues when I ask a question), one of them canceled the order in hurry and now they can't create a new replacement order. Asking me to return the defective phone and place a new order which is by paying 6500/- more whereas I placed the order on sale for 23.5k. One agent promised that he'll refund the new order but he disconnected the chat and the next agent is not respective that offer.Currently, I'm stuck with the defective phone and support team disconnected the chat even while talking and said we can't help you anymore. That Agent also sent an email with numerous links pushing the survey links to bottom and interestingly, he modified the survey URL's domain from Amazon.in to Amazon.co.uk to avoid feedback and this was by the either by the Escalations or Leadership team.Not just the frontline Support team, Escalations and Leadership teams are also irresponsible and have such unethical and unprofessional behavior. Not to mention, no one wants to check the previous chats, you have to repeat every single thing all over again and I've done this for 2 weeks with more than 15 Agents.Next: I'm taking this social media and consumer forums.

Very very IMP to read if you are planning to buy S20 FE 5G - Known display issue
","
Ever wondered why this model is also sold a large numbers which are refurbished? Thats because it has a display issue which are noticed within one month of purchase and if such phone arrives at service centre they replace them with another one with new phone if bought from offline store (if bought from amazon then they will repair only and you need to live with it). Then samsung repairs the faulty phone and sells as refurbished by the dealers. Otherwise such a latest model wouldnt have so many refurbished phones.Now below is my purchase experience.I bought this phone on 11th Aug 22 and on 19th Aug the display automatically stopped working. Since Amazon provides replacement for 7 days so I couldnt replace - I dont consider myself as unlucky because its the problem with most of the Samsung S20 FE 5G models, and if you go to Samsung customer review site you can see many customers complaining about it globally. Also if you visit Samsung Service Centre in India and just sit there for few hours then high chances 1-2 persons would come with this issue.I mailed to Samsung, Amazon and requested for replacement since it was a manufacturing issue but no one listened, I twitted but no help - just some usual response came from both Samsung and Amazon. Amazon said since 7 days passed so they cant help. Samsung said they dont replace online bought products although they have 14 days replacement policy but that is only for offline products.I was frustrated and raised greivance at consumer forum but there also Samsung said they cant replace the product since its purchased from Amazon. And after no help I asked Samsung Service Centre to repair the product to which they said they need to check if it was a physical damange or liquid damage etc. and they first scared me saying it looks like I messed with the product but later agreed when managed to convince them sitting the whole day in the service centre. now they are saying the screen isnt available or they are not able to order. I am holding the dead phone for almost a month now. If you are planning to buy this phone then consider yourself lucky and learn from my pathetic experience and just dont buy this phone. Better buy any other phone but not Samsung's.

A Phone with known screen black dead problem! Stay away from Samsung.
","
I bought this phone with high hopes, it worked fine for few days, but within 2 weeks screen went black. On checking the samsung forums and amazon reviews, I understood this is a known problem and there are many customers, probably almost everyone facing this same issue who got it online. Now probably its my turn to go to service centre. I am really surprised to see Samsung neglecting customers that too S series buyers. There are some cases where consumers have raised cases vs Samsung but no response. I sincerely request Amazon to stop selling such items with known issues, as they spoil your reputation. I know Samsung is a big giant, so was Micromax and Lava at one point. We trust Amazon on their reliability and quality, but such incidents spoil the whole experience. I already told my friend to buy offline and go for Oneplus as don't want him to face this challenge.One day Samsung will learn and pay for their ignorance towards customers like us. Now there are thousands who will never buy Samsung just because of their experience with S20 FE 5G. A sensible company will recall such products from consumers or provide them a permanent fix.I too pledge never to buy a Samsung mobile in future.Update: Visited the Service centre and they replaced the display and returned the mobile same day in few hours. I have not got extended warranty as am skeptical how long the display will last, so better to cover for 2 years. Post which we can say that investment was spent over.The only good thing is Service centre had spare display ready(probably anticipating all S20 users will visit at some point). The Person ahead of me was also visiting the centre with same issue of same model, so its evident that its mass batch issue. Ideally Samsung should recall and withdraw such products from market. Anyway probably Samsung know better what to be done, but my next mobile will never be Samsung.

Don't buy this model
","
Please do not buy samsung phones. I have bought Samsung S20 FE 5G phone before 20 days. My phone display has stopped working working now. I have seen many videos on your tube then I realized that it is common problem in this phone. Samsung service center is accepting it is manufacturing defect. However company is not ready to replace the phone. There are saying that only repair is possible. Which is  I ma fine with. All I want in return that send me confirmation on mail that same issue will not arise in future but they are not even ready to take guarantee for their own product. (THIS IS WHAT THIS BRAND IS). I have put my hard earn money on this phone.  I have visited service center for 6 time and have called in customer number many times yet there is not solution. Please if any one can guide me how to escalate this issue. It would be very much helpful.Updates. I am following up the company since last 25 days yet there is no solution from their end.I am have done so many research on it. It is manufacturing defect Samsung service center executive has told me that. I have all the proof. I am planning to file complain in court now. They are selling sub standard products. This my last Samsung phone which anyways I am not going to use it.  I will raise compensation demand in cash. Those who wants to file case. We can file a case in group as well. As we are facing same dead display problem (Display Blackout ). There are not just spoiling their image. Amazon has to look into this matter  as well. Please those wants to file case can join contact me on my email id girishpatel2433@gmail.com

Substandard product from samsung
","
I purchased it on 24 sep and on 23rd October morning after charging, the screen went blank(BSOD) and I cant use the mobile. 23 and 24 are service center holidays and on 25 th service center after taking around 1 hr time and opening my mobile confirmed that display is gone and needs to be replaced. Displays are out of stock and asked for 4-5 days time. Having no other option and as return window is closed by 1st October, i agreed . Still in warranty, hopefully the display replacement is free of cost. I met other guy with same issue same model and same one month usage.Seems this is a sub standard product from samsung. This is my first phone from samsung and used mobiles starting from Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, One Plus..this is my first visit to any mobile service center in the last 20 years or so. Totally disappointed with samsung.Just hoping the replaced display will come longer.Huge discount on this model in sale , may be I should have not fallen. Bye bye samsung after this phone.Update:I got mobile back on 29th Oct and display was replaced free of cost as it was under warranty. But lost all my Data(which was informed) and had to setup again from scratch.Just hoping this will not happen again even after warranty.Pretty sure this is my last mobile from samsung. Bye bye.Update2:Iam seeing lot of reviews where in many mentioning its issue with Amazon purchased mobiles only, NO, I met 2 guys when Iam in service center and both had purchased from the same store where service center is located. So its issue with Samsung doesnt matter it is store purchase or Amazon.

Screen black out issue within 15 min of delivery.

I got the order on 27th evening. I opened the package inserted the sim and started the phone while selecting the wifi option the screen went black. Phone was having 58% charge it is vibrating or making sound if I try to charge it.Imediately contacted customer care they said technician will come and see what is the issue. and they will proceed for the exchange. If any one went through this please let me know what solution did you got from this ?Now waiting for the Technician. I will update how this process goes..Day 2.Appointmnet for technician was fixed after 2 days.slot was 10 am to 2 pm. got a text message from amazon that I will be there till 10.30am.but thechinical guy did not show up. tried calling CC they assured they will arange it till 2pm but it was not done they have booked other slot after 2 days again.Now waiting for the next day.  I will update what the day unfolds on that day.Amazon Policy : ( As described by amazon customer care )1. They can only replace or refund ( whatever option available ) when the techincal guy give there report  to the amazon.  And there have been many cases where technical guy have submited a wrong report to amazon at last  customer suffers in this case.2. Amazon dose not have any control over the techincal service.  They can't find out where the technical person is they can't contact them they even can't communicate  with them. I don't know how amazon approve this kind of Important service on which they dont have  any control.

Phone Screen went dead in 10 days after purchase!
","
Please do your research about the phone before you buy this phone.I bought this phone from Amazon during the Dussehra Sale Offer and I was quite happy with the Amazon fast delivery. But after 10 days of use, one morning the phone screen went blank n dead.  The phone was working as i could hear the incoming call ringtone and also the phone vibrate but mobile screen was blackout.So immediately I took the phone to the nearest Samsung service center and told them the issue. Initially they said don't worry sir since it's just 10 days from activation Samsung has complete product return n replacement policy. But then when I said it's bought from Amazon they said sorry sir in that case we just have only the warranty coverage and no complete replacement applicable! Also, when I was in the service center seeing my samsung s20 fe box fellow customers who also had similar problem called out to me asking ""oh! same issue ah!"". There were 2 customers with similar issue (phone screen blackout in few days from purchase) on that day.I feel something is not right about the Samsung s20 fe 5G as a complete product. Maybe some QA check's were comprised before the product market release. If it's just one-off instance of similar issue we can ignore and say like 1 in 100 issue can happen but that's not the case here. I asked the Samsung CC person how many such issues reported, she said with a smile, yeah quite a few similar customer issues reported!

Black screen of death
","
Bought this during one of the sales for a decent amount of discount. But within a month of buying this phone the screen stopped working. It just went blank while I was browsing. I thought the phone shut down and kept trying to turn it on. But it wasn't responding. So I started removing the sim to put in a different phone and the phone made a sound as soon as the tray popped out, that's when I realised the phone is on but the screen had shut off.After some googling I found that this is fairly common for Samsung phones. It's been happening for many years and Samsung hasn't bothered to fix it. If only I had known this before buying the phone...This had even happened to my father's phone some 5 or so years ago. But it started back up after the phone battery discharged completely a day later, and didn't have a problem after that so brushed it off as a one off issue and didn't really look into it too much. Wasn't as lucky with this phone, will be going to a Samsung service center soon, lets see how that goes.Wanted to buy Samsung foldables in the future, but hesitant of Samsung phones in general now. Especially since this is a fairly frequent issue and they haven't bothered to fix it after so many years. And foldables have their own screen issues as well.Until this issue cropped up I was fairly happy with this phone. I would have given it 4.5 stars. One point that did bother me a bit was the weight. This thing is heavier and bulkier in hand than the M52 that my father has, despite having a smaller battery. I guess it is the better cameras and a metal frame addibg some weight. Premium touches no doubt, but the M52 is a bit more comfortable to hold in the hand and it has a marginally bigger screen and battery.  Anyway not a big deal, it was a good phone overall.

The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Just in 2 days after delivery
","
The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Phone was delivered on 02/10/22 and stopped working on 04/10/22. Phone screen gose completely black out suddenly while using. And now not starting. I tried to replace this via Amazon app but the option is not available their the only option is to get the technician visit and the slot is not available for technicain visit. After calling the Amazon customer care i got appointment for 07/10/22.I am editing this review today on 14/10/22 now my phone is replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Amazon and their customer support team. Now my phone is working fine.But i have one doubt if i i have got the new phone or not. The box was sealed but when I opened their was some dirt stick on the phone. As the phone screen guard was their. Also the charging adaptor was not properly at its place.  It seem that in transit these was displaced. But generally this dose not happen. As the package is made in such a way to avoid these displacementI want to ask Samsung and Amazone if they are supplying phone with screen guard applyed on Galaxy S20FE 5G. And durt on the screen guard. Is it standerd from Samsung. I think definitely not. Request Amazone and Samsung to clearify this. I have a doubt the phone i got is refurbished. I request Samsung to clearify my doubt by checking the sl no. And IMIE no. In their records.

FE means Fool's Edition

Screen - So-called Samsung's AMOLED is hype. It took me a lot of time to adjust to this screen because the colors are inaccurate.I'm using vivid mode with the white balance slider turned all the way to the right, i.e. warm.120Hz is a gimmick on this phone. You are forced to use it because 60Hz is unrealistically laggy. Compared to the aged Pixel 2XL, this phone is in no way faster by any means.Moreover, the refresh rate is not adaptive, therefore, battery drain is horrible.Speakers - Average, lack natural bass. The overall sound is on the sharper side.Battery - Poor. Don't trust screen on time. You have to charge it twice a day. I don't know what kind of a person is ""mild"" in this day and age.Performance - Software is poorly optimized. Performance is not good. It doesn't feel like a flagship.No headphone jack, but that's okay, nobody likes music anymore.Expandable storage - This is the only pro, everything else is a con. They removed this one too in S21 FE.Camera - Why do people say colors are subjective? Who purposefully likes unnatural oversaturated greens of foliage, exaggerated reds, and blues which look like they are painted on with a double brush?The overall photo is childish and basic. Compared to the Google Pixel 2, this camera is crap.And the camera app lags like crazy. It takes irritatingly long to get into the camera app, for it to be ready for clicking a shot.Ultrawide cameras are all gimmicks, so much more especially in this phone.Telephoto lacks resolution.The video quality is decent.The fingerprint sensor is horrible. Painful, really painful. You will curse it.Software - Thankfully no ads but miles away from the stock experience. Even though it has 865 SD, it feels like a middle-range phone. No, the software is NOT snappy. There are no glaring lags either but just not what you would expect. Or perhaps my expectations from a Samsung phone are unreasonable. Updates ain't so fast either. Samsung treats FE models as an afterthought.Bottom line - Don't buy this phone even if it sells for a single rupee above 30K. I made a mistake. Look elsewhere, don't be fooled by a ""near-flagship"" experience because there is none.

Samsung Fan, Good Phone, SCREEN BLACKOUT,  Great Camera
","
I have brought this phone on august 2022 on sale for 28600, That was a great deal for this phone and I have never seen this phone in this price range. I feel heating issue at first 2 days of use  while charging, streaming Youtube and playing games(BGMI). But after software update it seems fine and doesn't have that much heating issue any more. overall the phone looks good, camera is great and a descent battery life (1 day life with streaming + browsing + call ), finger print scanner is ok not that best in market. Battery wont be enough if you are a gamer.The real issue came after 3 months of use, one day the SCREEN got BLACKED OUT while using message app. I m a Samsung fan and I have been using Samsung phone's for around 15 year. This is the first time I m facing such an issue( only freezing issue found in previous phones ), it can be restarted but screen will be blacked out after a while. and it got fixed by SCREEN REPLACEMENT from service center. And the ISSUE is there for more users who PURCHASED on SALE DAY, some people already logged this in Samsung community. Only because of this I'm giving this phone a 2 star review.

Very disappointed product from Samsung
","
Very very disappointed, I never expected this kind of product from Samsung.Within 20 days (accurately after 17days of usage), the phone suddenly showed a black screen even though vibration and other things were working in the background. The black screen was not resolved even after trying hard booting many times. Since it was more than 14 days Service center team member told me that it can't be replaced but can be repaired.After an initial investigation, it was communicated that it is a defective piece. The screen and battery needed to be replaced. The estimated service time was 1 day.The next day when I enquired, they told me that the parts are not yet arrived and it will take 2 more days, Hoping that there will be no further delay.I never faced this kind of problem with Xiaomi phones before, I think I made the wrong decision to switch to Samsung phones. It has caused so much trouble as I am not able to authenticate my authentication on some of the cloud portals due to this issue.The only good point which made to buy this phone was the camera quality,  But what is the use of having a good camera when the phone itself is very unstable and has a black screen issue?

Much better options available in same range don't go for it

Camera clarity not good, even six years old  redmi note 6 has better camera then this I mean you can't compare its worst. Display is not up to the mark even samsung's own under 20k phones has better camera and display then this then why someone should go for this don't get fooled by online review they are all managed .

Problem with Amazon

I have been using Samsung products since 2007. First time unhappy with Samsung Galaxy S20 FE due to Amazon. Amazon is buying defective products and selling with little lower price than market. I would suggest not to buy Smart phones through Amazon.

Shocking poor build quality
","
Bought in Jun 2022, delivered on 25th Jun, I find this hardware button to be broken/disassociated on Nov 5, 2022. Lucky for me, the part got lodged in my pocket and I could put a cello-tape and sort of fix it (jugaad). However, this has convinced me to not go with Samsung products anymore. The quality is deteriorating. BTW, the phone never fell from my hand, had a protector almost immediately. Now of course, Samsung will claim I (or my kids, or somebody else) MUST have dropped it. I have spent too much of time setting this up, and I can't give it to anybody without a huge inconvenience.Photo taken on iPhone bought in Feb 2021, (for context), fell twice till now, also has protectors, going strong.

Not a good deal
","
It's been one month since I got trapped.1. Battery life is average. It takes a lot of time to get fully charged. If u use the phone while charging, it will take more than 5hrs for fully charged2. Back camera is very nice, but selfie camera is waste. U can't make quality reels and u will look like chudel in video calling. No flash for selfie camera in this price range.3. Touch is just ok.4. Phone is a bit heavy.5. Not worth for 30k at all. Think twice before you buy this 🤔.Note - I listed it on OLX already

"
With this price go with one plus
","
The price at which you are getting this phone...... you cab go with one plus either....one plus has good battery backup with fast charging support... even after spending 30k on Samsung we are not getting fast charging support...it only offers 25w that too you have to buy adapter separately.The seller has taken away too much time to deliver as well... no issue with product recevied the product in best condition.

Mobile suddenly and silently stopped display. Don't recommend this model.

I brought this mobile few days before Dusara festival as I had my old MI mobile and wanted a new one. Thought to buy Samsung as it is very popular one and went for this Samsung Galaxy 20 FE. Used it for 2-3 weeks very carefully as it was new mobile and wanted to keep it safe till Diwali at least :). I had my personal data and office apps on it. 2 days back i kept it near me and was doing office work. had to call my colleague for urgent work in the weekend and this mobile stopped display and had to suffer a lot as i had my office app, contact numbers etc and even UPI apps on it.now i am unable to return it from AMAZON website. Need to call Samsung customer care...don't know how is the support from Samsung. I would suggest not to go for this model.

Extremely disappointed with the Battery
","
The phone is great in many aspects; I purchased it even after reading about its average battery life, but I’m highly disappointed after 1 week of usage even after starting with low expectations.I charged my iPhone 12 and Samsung S20fe to 100% last night and left them on my desk when I slept; this morning when I woke up, the iPhone is still at 100% whereas Samsung is at 92% (after 8 hrs of no usage)On normal days (with screen on time of 2-3 hrs) the battery doesn’t even last till the evening, and this is despite 60hz refresh rate and turning off several battery consuming features like NFC, nearby device scanning, location, Auto app updates, several personalisation features. I checked in the setting and it says 3% was used by google play services, 1% WhatsApp and % Samsung store. I’ve set all of these apps on the most minimalist modes, and yet have this battery drain.Regret buying this phone. Feels like Samsung and Amazon sold me lemon by discounting it heavily

Wondering if it's a flagship!
","
This doesn't come with 25w charger and headsets out of box for such premium price.You have to buy it manually.Usb C to 3.5 jack adapter from samsung only works, if you like to use existing headset, so that's an additional purchase.If you're buying in 2022, you may get android update in Mar 2023 and security update till 2024.Observing heating issue while charging with regular 15w charger.Hope this helps!

In call sound is so loud. It's irritating. Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use headphones/headsets/earbuds,etc.  everytime while speaking. Or if you can use loudspeaker..And remember they have aped Apple hence no 3.5mm jack slot. Either Bluetooth or wired headset with type c cable.

Reviewing after 2 months of usage as my Primary device..
","
This is totally my personal opinion about the phone, there are too many aspects to talk about and it will definitely help you with your buying...1. Look and build: (8 out of 10)  Firstly it is a good-looking phone for me, simple and sober, with a metallic frame the phone feels good on the hands too, back made of plastic and not too prone to scratches, even I dropped it a couple of times but it is fine as of now. So the plastic build is a key for those who don't use covers. but you must regret not having a 3.5mm jack.2. DIsplay: (7 out of 10) To be honest display is good but not as good as other Samsung flagship, I was using it along with the Samsung S9 and Realme X2pro side by side on 1080p resolution but the s9 and X2pro look more sharp and bright as compared, Pixel density and brightness nits are satisfactory but not issue in outdoors. overall the display looks good.3. Performace:(7 out of 10) It is the key part for me, with regular day-to-day tasks, multitasking app switching everything is fine unless it comes to gaming. the device comes with SD865 and on paper, it is a very good  SOC for performance and for gaming also, but Samsung doing it very wrong in the part of gaming, I m daily driver Bgmi player and I play it a lot, in the term of gaming performance it works really poor as compared to my Realme X2pro with SD 855plus. with the smooth extreme setting, there are high Visible frame drops and stutters. frames drop as low as 40-35 fps as compared to X2pro which continues to maintain 55-60 fps. Samsung does not work well on gaming optimization. So as my view who looks for a good gaming phone go for Realme Oneplus or other but if gaming is not that matter then definitely go for this.4. Camera:(9 out of 10) It is another key point for me, the camera performance on this phone looks excellent, I am fond of photography and for me, the camera works really well on color balance dynamic range, etc. wide-angle camera and portrait mode is excellent and the sensor works really good on low light conditions. the primary sensor OIS works really well but Video mode with the wide-angle lens is missing. Samsung must add it with updates. Overall the camera is really good.5. Battery: (8 out of 10)4500 mah is kind of enough for a mid-user. it typically lasts for a day most of the time. Battery management and optimization are good. But for the heavy users with heavy app load and background load the phone needs to charge more than one time a day.6. multimedia:(9 out of 10) Videos and movie watching experience is fun on this as the volume is loud and the Dolby sound and stereo effect works really well.7.UI:(8 out of 10) Samsung One UI looks clean and good but comes with lots of preinstalled bloatware ( some of them are uninstallable ) and adds( can be disabled while device setup or from the settings) and Android 11 and Samsung Nox security is a key part of this phone as the device comes with hardware base extra layer of security. and Samsung is good at pushing regular security updates and 3 years platform update. and it makes the device future-proof.8. Network reception:(9 out of 10) I am using airtel as primary sim. there is not carrier aggregation in my area. but devices support it also it supports Vowifi and dual-band WIFI so no issue with the network reception.I brought it for 41k with an extra 7k discount. and it kind of value of money for me because of the Brand name. and it is a really good phone from Samsung. but in this price segment, and there are lots of other options to look for.

It is a wonderful mobile mainly in camera performance was very impressively and i am big fan of Samsung mobiles that's why i bought this mobile and i am fully satisfied but there is some cons also there like battery was drained early and charge mobile twice a day and fingerprint was slowly however overall product was very good and reasonable to buy

Bought this for Rs 26500 and worth every penny
","
Even though this phone was launched 2 years back but 865 processor is still worth Rs 26500. The Camera is just amazing! other mid-rangers like M52 , A52s etc. are not even close.The battery is decent but since my usage includes normal day-to-day functions - WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome,5-10 photo clicks and some paytm types app and I set the refresh rate to 60Hz, I am able to use it for 2 days easily on single charge. The phone comes by default with screen guard which is not tempered glass but does provide some protection. The back cover is glasstic and needs some protection, Either the phone cover is such that or best is to get a film protection for its back as well just like screen.Overall Battery is 8.5/10(For normal usage where 60Hz refresh rate is also fine)Camera is 10/10, front Camera  =  9/10Performance for normal user = 10/10(Not sure about gamers)In-Hand Feel is perfect= 9/10Screen Quality  = 10/10

It has a fast refresh rate of 120hz. The colors are saturated as usual in a Super Amoled panel. The display is very bright as well. It is very smooth.UI:Packed of features. There is no doubt that Samsung is one of the best UI out there for Android.Battery:The phone has 4500mah. Easily lasts a day. Could last even longer if used in 60hz. The phone supports upto 25w charging. It also supports reverse charging. It even supports reverse wireless charging!!Performance: A top of the line processor by Samsung. Would've been better if the indian version had gotten the Snapdragon 865 chipset. But the 5g Version does have SD 865 but it is much more costlier.Camera:The camera sure is 12MP but it takes much more details than expected by a 12MP camera. It is a very capable capable unit under bright environments. But you can see lots of noise in dark environments.Finaly.Cons:1. Battery drains fast.2. It supports 25W charging but comes with 15W charger.3. Little Heating problem.Pros:1. Fully water proof.(IP68 Rated).2. Powerful Processor.3. Camera is super good.

Amazon screwed up delivery for the first time. I cancelled and ordered again after a week availing exchange offer. Plus, got discount on using a certain credi card. For 25k, this is a fantastic phone. The camera is outstanding. I have a DSLR and can confidently say that this pictures from this phone are as good as that, quality wise. Thanks to 8GB RAM, the phone functions smoothly. The screen resolution is top notch. I read a lot of complaints on screen conking off after few days. It's been 10 days since I have been using the phone. Thankfully, no issues for me yet. Hoping for the best 😄 The phone charges very quickly and battery life is very good for a moderate user like me who doesn't watch too many videos or okays games. Overall a fantastic phone at this price range. Go for it 👍👍

Best Midrange mobile at 30k
","
Bought this for 30k (In prime sale + Bank offers and No COST EMI).Screen: Absolutely stunning, it supports 60Hz and 120Hz. It doesn't switch automatically between these settings, you need to select it from settings.Rear Camera: Really nice, seriously good. Not just good enough.Front camera - A bit disappointed, it's good but not as good as rear camera.Performance - You can play games like Call of duty or BGMI at Max graphics settings that the game supports. It heats up a bit after playing for a hour. Which is absolutely normal considering it has Snapdragon 865 and as saying goes with great processors comes a little bit of heatings. Just know that it's normal, don't expect any mobile to not heatup while charging or doing heavy works. That's universal.Finger Print reader - Good, no complains. Won't feel any significant delay or issues.Charger - It comes with 15W USB type C charger and it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to fully charge the battery. Mobile however supports upto 25W charger and it also supports wireless charging which I haven't tested. Don't buy a separate 25W charger for this, because the 25W charger takes only 10 minutes less than 15W charger to fully charge it.Sim cards - Supports 2 5G sim cards and upto 1TB (confirm this) expandable storage. However the slot is hybrid, it means you can't use both sim cards and external memory card at once. Either use both sim cards or 1 Sim card and external memory card.I don't think you will need external memory card because it has 128GB internal storage which is enough for normal users.It comes with Android 12 and Samsung one UI 4.1 and will support updates upto Android 13.It doesn't have headphone jack.Box contains - Mobile, Charger and Charger cable. Sim ejector.Amazon usually have discount (without prime sale), so don't buy without any discounts.As of August 2022, Expect it around 30k to 33k. Don't buy above this price because it randomly comes down to this price on some days.Personal suggestion: buy a cover ASAP. I droped it next morning and fortunately nothing broke, got a scratch around camera bump. Camera bump is made of glass-ish stuff and it can break very easily. So just keep that in mind.

Not worth the hype and money - Samsung should look at the design quality of M13

I had to replace the phone since it was stopping while playing videos and the touch wasn't working. I got a replacement phone and it has the same problems though touch is slightly better. The video playing either won't stop even if you push back button or will keep stopping intermittently as if buffering even with a 100MBps wifi or mobile data. I had to repair by broken Redmi with no option left and it work wonders.I suggest people can skip this phone for a better one. Samsung should look at the design quality of M13

Bad display. Contacts app is very pathetic

Display is way way way pathetic and dull. No contrasts...gives a feel that oil is spilled over screen. Phone needs to be operated at very high brightness settings.If you have saved a contact without adding+91 which generally is the case... it's not showing the name of saved contact because you have not saved +91 in your contact details.This kind of problem I am facing for the first time in any phone.Even non smart phones worth rs 2000k will show the name of contact if the main 10 digits are correct.This phone is not displaying contact just because you have saved  0 in place of +91 or just saved the 10 digits....

Worst mobile

The samsung and Amazon both fooled people.This is the first time I have tried to return a mobile and had worst experience with Amazon.Key Issues with mobile: Quickly device getting hot. Very much irritated during calls Battery drainage quicklyWorst Amazon support When I reached the CS support, they asked me to wait for a technical agent visit.  But the assigned technical agent left Amazon for more than year and I ended up co-ordinating with  CS support and that person.Again the next person avoided a personal visit and put me on a Minspect app and verified for few min. (Worst app at all and they promised for a personal visit but ended up on-call check)Again after a new call to the support team, they have agreed for a refund and asked me to update my pan card. But Again a new CS person refused that policy 🙄 🤔I don't know whether the intention of CS support is yo solve customer query or to time pass with us to feel irritated

mediocre laggy device
","
I bought this for my dad who is currently using M21 1st edition. Let me list down pros and consPros:1. 6000 mah battery2. Branded device. Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.3. Charger included in box (15w)Cons:1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery3.  very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.

Device performance

battery life, fingerprint reader are good. But there is lot of noise while taking foto in low light condition.One must also look the performance of the device. For the price range it's ok but there is drop in performance and frame rate while scrolling through Google news and youtube. Not only these there are lots of lag while using. I have been using m13 4g for 7 days. If you want to buy then go for the M13 5g model which offer more fluidity since it runs on MT D700 (7nm technology) which is more better performance  the exynos 850. Think carefully while buying.

WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT
","
Purchase this or anything on Amazon at your own risk, customer support is not going to help.My unit had a physical defect, gaps on the sides from the back panel and it's a serious issue considering the phone is ip68 rated (water resistant) and this gap can cause water damage. Poor quality control as I saw some other customers reporting same issue and some units also getting water damage and then Samsung can't help there.First, they can't replace directly now. Some technician will visit and verify the issue however no one called or showed up and then I get an email saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Support Reps on chat are disconnecting the chat saying they can't do anything, there's a different team for these issues which is rude. It's been more than 24 hours and no one joined that chat and yet I was told ""I have option to keep this chat window open so have you can get connect with your concern team""Lastly, cherry on top is that they CAN'T change the address for the Technician's visit even if you're not at the same location where the order was delivered. Due to this, I had to wait 4 hours on a different location for the Technician's visit and no one came except for the email later saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Basically, you're on own after purchasing from Amazon. Think before making bigger purchases.Update: Still unresolved and denied further supportAfter a week of back and forth, finally a replacement was created however it wasn't delivered. For 5 days straight, it kept saying ""Now arriving today"" and ""Rescheduled"" and it's just stuck there.After countless hours with ~15 support and escalation agents (they all have technical issues when I ask a question), one of them canceled the order in hurry and now they can't create a new replacement order. Asking me to return the defective phone and place a new order which is by paying 6500/- more whereas I placed the order on sale for 23.5k. One agent promised that he'll refund the new order but he disconnected the chat and the next agent is not respective that offer.Currently, I'm stuck with the defective phone and support team disconnected the chat even while talking and said we can't help you anymore. That Agent also sent an email with numerous links pushing the survey links to bottom and interestingly, he modified the survey URL's domain from Amazon.in to Amazon.co.uk to avoid feedback and this was by the either by the Escalations or Leadership team.Not just the frontline Support team, Escalations and Leadership teams are also irresponsible and have such unethical and unprofessional behavior. Not to mention, no one wants to check the previous chats, you have to repeat every single thing all over again and I've done this for 2 weeks with more than 15 Agents.Next: I'm taking this social media and consumer forums.

Very very IMP to read if you are planning to buy S20 FE 5G - Known display issue
","
Ever wondered why this model is also sold a large numbers which are refurbished? Thats because it has a display issue which are noticed within one month of purchase and if such phone arrives at service centre they replace them with another one with new phone if bought from offline store (if bought from amazon then they will repair only and you need to live with it). Then samsung repairs the faulty phone and sells as refurbished by the dealers. Otherwise such a latest model wouldnt have so many refurbished phones.Now below is my purchase experience.I bought this phone on 11th Aug 22 and on 19th Aug the display automatically stopped working. Since Amazon provides replacement for 7 days so I couldnt replace - I dont consider myself as unlucky because its the problem with most of the Samsung S20 FE 5G models, and if you go to Samsung customer review site you can see many customers complaining about it globally. Also if you visit Samsung Service Centre in India and just sit there for few hours then high chances 1-2 persons would come with this issue.I mailed to Samsung, Amazon and requested for replacement since it was a manufacturing issue but no one listened, I twitted but no help - just some usual response came from both Samsung and Amazon. Amazon said since 7 days passed so they cant help. Samsung said they dont replace online bought products although they have 14 days replacement policy but that is only for offline products.I was frustrated and raised greivance at consumer forum but there also Samsung said they cant replace the product since its purchased from Amazon. And after no help I asked Samsung Service Centre to repair the product to which they said they need to check if it was a physical damange or liquid damage etc. and they first scared me saying it looks like I messed with the product but later agreed when managed to convince them sitting the whole day in the service centre. now they are saying the screen isnt available or they are not able to order. I am holding the dead phone for almost a month now. If you are planning to buy this phone then consider yourself lucky and learn from my pathetic experience and just dont buy this phone. Better buy any other phone but not Samsung's.

A Phone with known screen black dead problem! Stay away from Samsung.
","
I bought this phone with high hopes, it worked fine for few days, but within 2 weeks screen went black. On checking the samsung forums and amazon reviews, I understood this is a known problem and there are many customers, probably almost everyone facing this same issue who got it online. Now probably its my turn to go to service centre. I am really surprised to see Samsung neglecting customers that too S series buyers. There are some cases where consumers have raised cases vs Samsung but no response. I sincerely request Amazon to stop selling such items with known issues, as they spoil your reputation. I know Samsung is a big giant, so was Micromax and Lava at one point. We trust Amazon on their reliability and quality, but such incidents spoil the whole experience. I already told my friend to buy offline and go for Oneplus as don't want him to face this challenge.One day Samsung will learn and pay for their ignorance towards customers like us. Now there are thousands who will never buy Samsung just because of their experience with S20 FE 5G. A sensible company will recall such products from consumers or provide them a permanent fix.I too pledge never to buy a Samsung mobile in future.Update: Visited the Service centre and they replaced the display and returned the mobile same day in few hours. I have not got extended warranty as am skeptical how long the display will last, so better to cover for 2 years. Post which we can say that investment was spent over.The only good thing is Service centre had spare display ready(probably anticipating all S20 users will visit at some point). The Person ahead of me was also visiting the centre with same issue of same model, so its evident that its mass batch issue. Ideally Samsung should recall and withdraw such products from market. Anyway probably Samsung know better what to be done, but my next mobile will never be Samsung.

Don't buy this model
","
Please do not buy samsung phones. I have bought Samsung S20 FE 5G phone before 20 days. My phone display has stopped working working now. I have seen many videos on your tube then I realized that it is common problem in this phone. Samsung service center is accepting it is manufacturing defect. However company is not ready to replace the phone. There are saying that only repair is possible. Which is  I ma fine with. All I want in return that send me confirmation on mail that same issue will not arise in future but they are not even ready to take guarantee for their own product. (THIS IS WHAT THIS BRAND IS). I have put my hard earn money on this phone.  I have visited service center for 6 time and have called in customer number many times yet there is not solution. Please if any one can guide me how to escalate this issue. It would be very much helpful.Updates. I am following up the company since last 25 days yet there is no solution from their end.I am have done so many research on it. It is manufacturing defect Samsung service center executive has told me that. I have all the proof. I am planning to file complain in court now. They are selling sub standard products. This my last Samsung phone which anyways I am not going to use it.  I will raise compensation demand in cash. Those who wants to file case. We can file a case in group as well. As we are facing same dead display problem (Display Blackout ). There are not just spoiling their image. Amazon has to look into this matter  as well. Please those wants to file case can join contact me on my email id girishpatel2433@gmail.com

Substandard product from samsung
","
I purchased it on 24 sep and on 23rd October morning after charging, the screen went blank(BSOD) and I cant use the mobile. 23 and 24 are service center holidays and on 25 th service center after taking around 1 hr time and opening my mobile confirmed that display is gone and needs to be replaced. Displays are out of stock and asked for 4-5 days time. Having no other option and as return window is closed by 1st October, i agreed . Still in warranty, hopefully the display replacement is free of cost. I met other guy with same issue same model and same one month usage.Seems this is a sub standard product from samsung. This is my first phone from samsung and used mobiles starting from Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, One Plus..this is my first visit to any mobile service center in the last 20 years or so. Totally disappointed with samsung.Just hoping the replaced display will come longer.Huge discount on this model in sale , may be I should have not fallen. Bye bye samsung after this phone.Update:I got mobile back on 29th Oct and display was replaced free of cost as it was under warranty. But lost all my Data(which was informed) and had to setup again from scratch.Just hoping this will not happen again even after warranty.Pretty sure this is my last mobile from samsung. Bye bye.Update2:Iam seeing lot of reviews where in many mentioning its issue with Amazon purchased mobiles only, NO, I met 2 guys when Iam in service center and both had purchased from the same store where service center is located. So its issue with Samsung doesnt matter it is store purchase or Amazon.

Screen black out issue within 15 min of delivery.
","
I got the order on 27th evening. I opened the package inserted the sim and started the phone while selecting the wifi option the screen went black. Phone was having 58% charge it is vibrating or making sound if I try to charge it.Imediately contacted customer care they said technician will come and see what is the issue. and they will proceed for the exchange. If any one went through this please let me know what solution did you got from this ?Now waiting for the Technician. I will update how this process goes..Day 2.Appointmnet for technician was fixed after 2 days.slot was 10 am to 2 pm. got a text message from amazon that I will be there till 10.30am.but thechinical guy did not show up. tried calling CC they assured they will arange it till 2pm but it was not done they have booked other slot after 2 days again.Now waiting for the next day.  I will update what the day unfolds on that day.Amazon Policy : ( As described by amazon customer care )1. They can only replace or refund ( whatever option available ) when the techincal guy give there report  to the amazon.  And there have been many cases where technical guy have submited a wrong report to amazon at last  customer suffers in this case.2. Amazon dose not have any control over the techincal service.  They can't find out where the technical person is they can't contact them they even can't communicate  with them. I don't know how amazon approve this kind of Important service on which they dont have  any control.

Phone Screen went dead in 10 days after purchase!
","
Please do your research about the phone before you buy this phone.I bought this phone from Amazon during the Dussehra Sale Offer and I was quite happy with the Amazon fast delivery. But after 10 days of use, one morning the phone screen went blank n dead.  The phone was working as i could hear the incoming call ringtone and also the phone vibrate but mobile screen was blackout.So immediately I took the phone to the nearest Samsung service center and told them the issue. Initially they said don't worry sir since it's just 10 days from activation Samsung has complete product return n replacement policy. But then when I said it's bought from Amazon they said sorry sir in that case we just have only the warranty coverage and no complete replacement applicable! Also, when I was in the service center seeing my samsung s20 fe box fellow customers who also had similar problem called out to me asking ""oh! same issue ah!"". There were 2 customers with similar issue (phone screen blackout in few days from purchase) on that day.I feel something is not right about the Samsung s20 fe 5G as a complete product. Maybe some QA check's were comprised before the product market release. If it's just one-off instance of similar issue we can ignore and say like 1 in 100 issue can happen but that's not the case here. I asked the Samsung CC person how many such issues reported, she said with a smile, yeah quite a few similar customer issues reported!

Black screen of death
","
Bought this during one of the sales for a decent amount of discount. But within a month of buying this phone the screen stopped working. It just went blank while I was browsing. I thought the phone shut down and kept trying to turn it on. But it wasn't responding. So I started removing the sim to put in a different phone and the phone made a sound as soon as the tray popped out, that's when I realised the phone is on but the screen had shut off.After some googling I found that this is fairly common for Samsung phones. It's been happening for many years and Samsung hasn't bothered to fix it. If only I had known this before buying the phone...This had even happened to my father's phone some 5 or so years ago. But it started back up after the phone battery discharged completely a day later, and didn't have a problem after that so brushed it off as a one off issue and didn't really look into it too much. Wasn't as lucky with this phone, will be going to a Samsung service center soon, lets see how that goes.Wanted to buy Samsung foldables in the future, but hesitant of Samsung phones in general now. Especially since this is a fairly frequent issue and they haven't bothered to fix it after so many years. And foldables have their own screen issues as well.Until this issue cropped up I was fairly happy with this phone. I would have given it 4.5 stars. One point that did bother me a bit was the weight. This thing is heavier and bulkier in hand than the M52 that my father has, despite having a smaller battery. I guess it is the better cameras and a metal frame addibg some weight. Premium touches no doubt, but the M52 is a bit more comfortable to hold in the hand and it has a marginally bigger screen and battery.  Anyway not a big deal, it was a good phone overall.

The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Just in 2 days after delivery
","
The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Phone was delivered on 02/10/22 and stopped working on 04/10/22. Phone screen gose completely black out suddenly while using. And now not starting. I tried to replace this via Amazon app but the option is not available their the only option is to get the technician visit and the slot is not available for technicain visit. After calling the Amazon customer care i got appointment for 07/10/22.I am editing this review today on 14/10/22 now my phone is replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Amazon and their customer support team. Now my phone is working fine.But i have one doubt if i i have got the new phone or not. The box was sealed but when I opened their was some dirt stick on the phone. As the phone screen guard was their. Also the charging adaptor was not properly at its place.  It seem that in transit these was displaced. But generally this dose not happen. As the package is made in such a way to avoid these displacementI want to ask Samsung and Amazone if they are supplying phone with screen guard applyed on Galaxy S20FE 5G. And durt on the screen guard. Is it standerd from Samsung. I think definitely not. Request Amazone and Samsung to clearify this. I have a doubt the phone i got is refurbished. I request Samsung to clearify my doubt by checking the sl no. And IMIE no. In their records.

FE means Fool's Edition
","
Screen - So-called Samsung's AMOLED is hype. It took me a lot of time to adjust to this screen because the colors are inaccurate.I'm using vivid mode with the white balance slider turned all the way to the right, i.e. warm.120Hz is a gimmick on this phone. You are forced to use it because 60Hz is unrealistically laggy. Compared to the aged Pixel 2XL, this phone is in no way faster by any means.Moreover, the refresh rate is not adaptive, therefore, battery drain is horrible.Speakers - Average, lack natural bass. The overall sound is on the sharper side.Battery - Poor. Don't trust screen on time. You have to charge it twice a day. I don't know what kind of a person is ""mild"" in this day and age.Performance - Software is poorly optimized. Performance is not good. It doesn't feel like a flagship.No headphone jack, but that's okay, nobody likes music anymore.Expandable storage - This is the only pro, everything else is a con. They removed this one too in S21 FE.Camera - Why do people say colors are subjective? Who purposefully likes unnatural oversaturated greens of foliage, exaggerated reds, and blues which look like they are painted on with a double brush?The overall photo is childish and basic. Compared to the Google Pixel 2, this camera is crap.And the camera app lags like crazy. It takes irritatingly long to get into the camera app, for it to be ready for clicking a shot.Ultrawide cameras are all gimmicks, so much more especially in this phone.Telephoto lacks resolution.The video quality is decent.The fingerprint sensor is horrible. Painful, really painful. You will curse it.Software - Thankfully no ads but miles away from the stock experience. Even though it has 865 SD, it feels like a middle-range phone. No, the software is NOT snappy. There are no glaring lags either but just not what you would expect. Or perhaps my expectations from a Samsung phone are unreasonable. Updates ain't so fast either. Samsung treats FE models as an afterthought.Bottom line - Don't buy this phone even if it sells for a single rupee above 30K. I made a mistake. Look elsewhere, don't be fooled by a ""near-flagship"" experience because there is none.

Samsung Fan, Good Phone, SCREEN BLACKOUT,  Great Camera
","
I have brought this phone on august 2022 on sale for 28600, That was a great deal for this phone and I have never seen this phone in this price range. I feel heating issue at first 2 days of use  while charging, streaming Youtube and playing games(BGMI). But after software update it seems fine and doesn't have that much heating issue any more. overall the phone looks good, camera is great and a descent battery life (1 day life with streaming + browsing + call ), finger print scanner is ok not that best in market. Battery wont be enough if you are a gamer.The real issue came after 3 months of use, one day the SCREEN got BLACKED OUT while using message app. I m a Samsung fan and I have been using Samsung phone's for around 15 year. This is the first time I m facing such an issue( only freezing issue found in previous phones ), it can be restarted but screen will be blacked out after a while. and it got fixed by SCREEN REPLACEMENT from service center. And the ISSUE is there for more users who PURCHASED on SALE DAY, some people already logged this in Samsung community. Only because of this I'm giving this phone a 2 star review.

Very disappointed product from Samsung
","
Very very disappointed, I never expected this kind of product from Samsung.Within 20 days (accurately after 17days of usage), the phone suddenly showed a black screen even though vibration and other things were working in the background. The black screen was not resolved even after trying hard booting many times. Since it was more than 14 days Service center team member told me that it can't be replaced but can be repaired.After an initial investigation, it was communicated that it is a defective piece. The screen and battery needed to be replaced. The estimated service time was 1 day.The next day when I enquired, they told me that the parts are not yet arrived and it will take 2 more days, Hoping that there will be no further delay.I never faced this kind of problem with Xiaomi phones before, I think I made the wrong decision to switch to Samsung phones. It has caused so much trouble as I am not able to authenticate my authentication on some of the cloud portals due to this issue.The only good point which made to buy this phone was the camera quality,  But what is the use of having a good camera when the phone itself is very unstable and has a black screen issue?

Shocking poor build quality
","
Bought in Jun 2022, delivered on 25th Jun, I find this hardware button to be broken/disassociated on Nov 5, 2022. Lucky for me, the part got lodged in my pocket and I could put a cello-tape and sort of fix it (jugaad). However, this has convinced me to not go with Samsung products anymore. The quality is deteriorating. BTW, the phone never fell from my hand, had a protector almost immediately. Now of course, Samsung will claim I (or my kids, or somebody else) MUST have dropped it. I have spent too much of time setting this up, and I can't give it to anybody without a huge inconvenience.Photo taken on iPhone bought in Feb 2021, (for context), fell twice till now, also has protectors, going strong.

Not a good deal

It's been one month since I got trapped.1. Battery life is average. It takes a lot of time to get fully charged. If u use the phone while charging, it will take more than 5hrs for fully charged2. Back camera is very nice, but selfie camera is waste. U can't make quality reels and u will look like chudel in video calling. No flash for selfie camera in this price range.3. Touch is just ok.4. Phone is a bit heavy.5. Not worth for 30k at all. Think twice before you buy this 🤔.Note - I listed it on OLX already

The price at which you are getting this phone...... you cab go with one plus either....one plus has good battery backup with fast charging support... even after spending 30k on Samsung we are not getting fast charging support...it only offers 25w that too you have to buy adapter separately.The seller has taken away too much time to deliver as well... no issue with product recevied the product in best condition.

Mobile suddenly and silently stopped display. Don't recommend this model.

I brought this mobile few days before Dusara festival as I had my old MI mobile and wanted a new one. Thought to buy Samsung as it is very popular one and went for this Samsung Galaxy 20 FE. Used it for 2-3 weeks very carefully as it was new mobile and wanted to keep it safe till Diwali at least :). I had my personal data and office apps on it. 2 days back i kept it near me and was doing office work. had to call my colleague for urgent work in the weekend and this mobile stopped display and had to suffer a lot as i had my office app, contact numbers etc and even UPI apps on it.now i am unable to return it from AMAZON website. Need to call Samsung customer care...don't know how is the support from Samsung. I would suggest not to go for this model.

The phone is great in many aspects; I purchased it even after reading about its average battery life, but I’m highly disappointed after 1 week of usage even after starting with low expectations.I charged my iPhone 12 and Samsung S20fe to 100% last night and left them on my desk when I slept; this morning when I woke up, the iPhone is still at 100% whereas Samsung is at 92% (after 8 hrs of no usage)On normal days (with screen on time of 2-3 hrs) the battery doesn’t even last till the evening, and this is despite 60hz refresh rate and turning off several battery consuming features like NFC, nearby device scanning, location, Auto app updates, several personalisation features. I checked in the setting and it says 3% was used by google play services, 1% WhatsApp and % Samsung store. I’ve set all of these apps on the most minimalist modes, and yet have this battery drain.Regret buying this phone. Feels like Samsung and Amazon sold me lemon by discounting it heavily

Back Camera is good front one is not good even my Galaxy M 51 has better front Camera and battery back as well not good.Finger print scanner is ok but not as good it should be for a mid Level  flagship phone. Rest all is good.

What a waste of money. I am yet to find a good thing about this phone other than the size. I would have rather used the same price and brought a OnePlus or MI. My worst phone ever

Its camera is good and battery also lasts more than a day however it lags when I use Samsung Dex or screen cast also sometimes a lot of ads interruption no matter what application you are using.

Overall phone is good but over priced
","
Camera is best, display is great but in Samsung OS most of the apps are not working due to modified OS. Second point is, it is really over priced. I don't know why this phone is too costly as there is nothing new in this phone as compared to all other Samsung phones in the price 10K to 30K

Wondering if it's a flagship!
","
This doesn't come with 25w charger and headsets out of box for such premium price.You have to buy it manually.Usb C to 3.5 jack adapter from samsung only works, if you like to use existing headset, so that's an additional purchase.If you're buying in 2022, you may get android update in Mar 2023 and security update till 2024.Observing heating issue while charging with regular 15w charger.Hope this helps!

Not really a flagship
","
In call sound is so loud. It's irritating. Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use headphones/headsets/earbuds,etc.  everytime while speaking. Or if you can use loudspeaker..And remember they have aped Apple hence no 3.5mm jack slot. Either Bluetooth or wired headset with type c cable.

Camera is good but AI beautification (for selfie etc) is not there. U hav to edit if u need those as it clicks original. Girls did not like selfie cam.ProsRest all(battery, display, ui) good.

Reviewing after 2 months of usage as my Primary device..
","
This is totally my personal opinion about the phone, there are too many aspects to talk about and it will definitely help you with your buying...1. Look and build: (8 out of 10)  Firstly it is a good-looking phone for me, simple and sober, with a metallic frame the phone feels good on the hands too, back made of plastic and not too prone to scratches, even I dropped it a couple of times but it is fine as of now. So the plastic build is a key for those who don't use covers. but you must regret not having a 3.5mm jack.2. DIsplay: (7 out of 10) To be honest display is good but not as good as other Samsung flagship, I was using it along with the Samsung S9 and Realme X2pro side by side on 1080p resolution but the s9 and X2pro look more sharp and bright as compared, Pixel density and brightness nits are satisfactory but not issue in outdoors. overall the display looks good.3. Performace:(7 out of 10) It is the key part for me, with regular day-to-day tasks, multitasking app switching everything is fine unless it comes to gaming. the device comes with SD865 and on paper, it is a very good  SOC for performance and for gaming also, but Samsung doing it very wrong in the part of gaming, I m daily driver Bgmi player and I play it a lot, in the term of gaming performance it works really poor as compared to my Realme X2pro with SD 855plus. with the smooth extreme setting, there are high Visible frame drops and stutters. frames drop as low as 40-35 fps as compared to X2pro which continues to maintain 55-60 fps. Samsung does not work well on gaming optimization. So as my view who looks for a good gaming phone go for Realme Oneplus or other but if gaming is not that matter then definitely go for this.4. Camera:(9 out of 10) It is another key point for me, the camera performance on this phone looks excellent, I am fond of photography and for me, the camera works really well on color balance dynamic range, etc. wide-angle camera and portrait mode is excellent and the sensor works really good on low light conditions. the primary sensor OIS works really well but Video mode with the wide-angle lens is missing. Samsung must add it with updates. Overall the camera is really good.5. Battery: (8 out of 10)4500 mah is kind of enough for a mid-user. it typically lasts for a day most of the time. Battery management and optimization are good. But for the heavy users with heavy app load and background load the phone needs to charge more than one time a day.6. multimedia:(9 out of 10) Videos and movie watching experience is fun on this as the volume is loud and the Dolby sound and stereo effect works really well.7.UI:(8 out of 10) Samsung One UI looks clean and good but comes with lots of preinstalled bloatware ( some of them are uninstallable ) and adds( can be disabled while device setup or from the settings) and Android 11 and Samsung Nox security is a key part of this phone as the device comes with hardware base extra layer of security. and Samsung is good at pushing regular security updates and 3 years platform update. and it makes the device future-proof.8. Network reception:(9 out of 10) I am using airtel as primary sim. there is not carrier aggregation in my area. but devices support it also it supports Vowifi and dual-band WIFI so no issue with the network reception.I brought it for 41k with an extra 7k discount. and it kind of value of money for me because of the Brand name. and it is a really good phone from Samsung. but in this price segment, and there are lots of other options to look for.

Bought this for Rs 26500 and worth every penny
","
Even though this phone was launched 2 years back but 865 processor is still worth Rs 26500. The Camera is just amazing! other mid-rangers like M52 , A52s etc. are not even close.The battery is decent but since my usage includes normal day-to-day functions - WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome,5-10 photo clicks and some paytm types app and I set the refresh rate to 60Hz, I am able to use it for 2 days easily on single charge. The phone comes by default with screen guard which is not tempered glass but does provide some protection. The back cover is glasstic and needs some protection, Either the phone cover is such that or best is to get a film protection for its back as well just like screen.Overall Battery is 8.5/10(For normal usage where 60Hz refresh rate is also fine)Camera is 10/10, front Camera  =  9/10Performance for normal user = 10/10(Not sure about gamers)In-Hand Feel is perfect= 9/10Screen Quality  = 10/10

Very Smooth phone

DisPlay- 5 star.Processor- 5 Star-5G Ready powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Octa-Core processor.Battery- 3.5 Star-Speaker- 5 star.Fingerprint-3.5 star.Camera-5 star.Design- 5 star.Build quality- 5 star.Display:The display has a Super Amoled Panel. It has a fast refresh rate of 120hz. The colors are saturated as usual in a Super Amoled panel. The display is very bright as well. It is very smooth.UI:Packed of features. There is no doubt that Samsung is one of the best UI out there for Android.Battery:The phone has 4500mah. Easily lasts a day. Could last even longer if used in 60hz. The phone supports upto 25w charging. It also supports reverse charging. It even supports reverse wireless charging!!Performance: A top of the line processor by Samsung. Would've been better if the indian version had gotten the Snapdragon 865 chipset. But the 5g Version does have SD 865 but it is much more costlier.Camera:The camera sure is 12MP but it takes much more details than expected by a 12MP camera. It is a very capable capable unit under bright environments. But you can see lots of noise in dark environments.Finaly.Cons:1. Battery drains fast.2. It supports 25W charging but comes with 15W charger.3. Little Heating problem.Pros:1. Fully water proof.(IP68 Rated).2. Powerful Processor.3. Camera is super good.

Superb camera, speed, resolution

Amazon screwed up delivery for the first time. I cancelled and ordered again after a week availing exchange offer. Plus, got discount on using a certain credi card. For 25k, this is a fantastic phone. The camera is outstanding. I have a DSLR and can confidently say that this pictures from this phone are as good as that, quality wise. Thanks to 8GB RAM, the phone functions smoothly. The screen resolution is top notch. I read a lot of complaints on screen conking off after few days. It's been 10 days since I have been using the phone. Thankfully, no issues for me yet. Hoping for the best 😄 The phone charges very quickly and battery life is very good for a moderate user like me who doesn't watch too many videos or okays games. Overall a fantastic phone at this price range. Go for it 👍👍

S20 FE 5g is very good product. I like the look and feel . Its real nice. Network connectivity is excellent. I get good 4G plus network.  5g is still not launched in my city. So can't talk about 5g. Bettery optimisation is very good. And nothing to say more about the software experience.  Its Samsung One UI. Just Great , no lag , no bug . I find it like this. So finally it a very good product by Samsung.

Best Midrange mobile at 30k
","
Bought this for 30k (In prime sale + Bank offers and No COST EMI).Screen: Absolutely stunning, it supports 60Hz and 120Hz. It doesn't switch automatically between these settings, you need to select it from settings.Rear Camera: Really nice, seriously good. Not just good enough.Front camera - A bit disappointed, it's good but not as good as rear camera.Performance - You can play games like Call of duty or BGMI at Max graphics settings that the game supports. It heats up a bit after playing for a hour. Which is absolutely normal considering it has Snapdragon 865 and as saying goes with great processors comes a little bit of heatings. Just know that it's normal, don't expect any mobile to not heatup while charging or doing heavy works. That's universal.Finger Print reader - Good, no complains. Won't feel any significant delay or issues.Charger - It comes with 15W USB type C charger and it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to fully charge the battery. Mobile however supports upto 25W charger and it also supports wireless charging which I haven't tested. Don't buy a separate 25W charger for this, because the 25W charger takes only 10 minutes less than 15W charger to fully charge it.Sim cards - Supports 2 5G sim cards and upto 1TB (confirm this) expandable storage. However the slot is hybrid, it means you can't use both sim cards and external memory card at once. Either use both sim cards or 1 Sim card and external memory card.I don't think you will need external memory card because it has 128GB internal storage which is enough for normal users.It comes with Android 12 and Samsung one UI 4.1 and will support updates upto Android 13.It doesn't have headphone jack.Box contains - Mobile, Charger and Charger cable. Sim ejector.Amazon usually have discount (without prime sale), so don't buy without any discounts.As of August 2022, Expect it around 30k to 33k. Don't buy above this price because it randomly comes down to this price on some days.Personal suggestion: buy a cover ASAP. I droped it next morning and fortunately nothing broke, got a scratch around camera bump. Camera bump is made of glass-ish stuff and it can break very easily. So just keep that in mind.

Received defective phone and running from one customer care to another to replace the phone
","
Below is the experience so far.1. Received a defective product. Battery was getting drained out in few hours, wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble,  including Google maps. (Location was not getting captured)2. Tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app I open. (tried on 7th night as well, but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile - Amazon app was in this phone. Used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile)3. Amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6. First visit to center, they did a software update (3 week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending) and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. Faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. Second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn't allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they don't have the authority for that.10. Called customer care number again, and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the seller.So back to step 3. Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , If I manage to reach there.Update :11. All customer care said they can't replace the phone. So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. Again, whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again.12. I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist (battery was draining out by the minute). I showed it to them. They told me it's a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. They also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. Used for 2 days. Same situation. No improvement.13. Went back to them again. They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience.17. I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. They refused with all their might and said ""phone is working now"". During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. I officially registered a complaint. But still no luck of returning the phone.Update on Nov 30th.18. I was traveling and outside the country. On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70% charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980's. Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times. No luck. Still grid lines. My flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip.19. Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. (Nov 30th.) Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. They mentioned ""patch issue. Software update dint happen"" . At this point, I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. No 3 month old phone's screen will stop responding because of software update missing. They are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.

Worst phone money can buy.

It was an awful GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL'22 for me. I bundle ordered this phone along with a pathetic mattress from Wakefit. The mattress got cancelled 3 days after scheduled delivery, and this phone does not even work.4 hours into using it, I was on a phone call and suddenly it makes a lot of noise that goes away on speaker mode only to return upon turning the speaker OFF. While still continuing with the speaker mode, the call was dropped. After repeated attempts to place the call I realized SIM 1 is not recognized. I turned off and reinserted a different SIM, and it still read NO SIM 1. There is this obnoxious heating part which I discounted in the initial few hours, but it only got worse in that limited time this phone worked.Soon it started going insane, restarting every few seconds and I was tired after a long day at work. I just dropped it on my study table to go to sleep and whole night it gave a DJ lighting effect while turning ON and OFF all on its own!This is not even the worst, I contacted Amazon; a TECHNICAL EXPERT says she couldn't initiate a return/refund on this product. She rechecked only to say not possible. She can only exchange the phone that too after a diagnosis by their expert who will visit me 3 days later! Like I said in the first paragraph, I reminded her off my mattress that was cancelled from their end. She feels so SORRY about it, but wont accept return. That's rich! They are okay with seller cancelling the delivery without informing the customer, that too after making the customer wait for 11 days. But they won't accept a return on an insane piece of crap that they call M53.I asked her to transfer the call to the team that will answer about my mattress and she did. This guy seems sensible and accepted the return in few minutes of explaining the issue. He promptly arranged for the return pick-up next day. This was the Amazon India I have known for years, but now! I returned the phone after a lot of effort and currently waiting for the refund as I type this.To try a non-Chinese midrange phone I have gone for this, but now I wouldn't dare to buy a Samsung phone again.

Samsung is a joke!! Never purchase a samsung phone again

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the recently purchased product which is the Samsung M53 5G. I am really disappointed with the phone and the service centre. I have faced plenty of problems.Let me explain problems in the detail. I purchased a cell phone on 16th May 2022. It worked well for a couple of days. As I continued to use it, I found faults in the handset. Firstly, it played random noise at random times at any point in time. Thus, to fix it I went to the service centre. I explained everything to the service centre. They said that the latest software update would fix the problem so they took their time and updated the software. After a couple of days, new issue raised. i.e., the screen of the phone blacked out automatically. Nothing seemed to work when the screen was off. This was really frustrating.I don’t understand how the new phone within 15 days of purchase can work like a faulty piece? I chose this phone over Apple and OnePlus after considering all the factors and it seems to be the wrong choice for me after all. The surprising thing is when I asked the centre to replace the phone as it was creating a lot of problems and I can’t every time leave my office to fix the issues they denied and said we could do it if it is within 14 days from the date of purchase. However, it was 15 days so they did not do it. I really think this is a ridiculous way of taking care of customers.My phone is in WARRANTY (ONLY BEEN 15 DAYS)!Never purchase samsung phone!! Terrible experienceA REALLY FRUSTRATED CUSTOMER!!

Avoid Samsung

Samsung low range, mid range(upto 50k) mobile phone just sell only for brand & our mind is set for non Chinese brand, other wise Samsung make most third class phone in this price brand,A. No very good build quality (cheap type plstic & paint) B. Always use low quality processor (exenyos or or low end midiatek)C. Always use Samsung sensor for camera in this range, i have 20mp old dual camera HONOR phone, much much better than 108mp(only for show)D. Its amoled skin is only good part but that time he use below 400ppi & lower brightness (not proper show in sunlight)E. In few months lag also comingD. Only 25w charging speed,Now new technic no charger in tbe box,No screen guard applied, no back cover, no 3.5mm converter jack in the box. (local converter not work properly, only original Samsung converter will work, which price almost 800rs..now not available in Samsung store)This brand only running for our government support.. Nothing else..In this price range or below u get much much good quality phone in the market..My old phone was almost 4 years but camera is much better than & performance, display also very good.Samsung midrange just waist of the money..

Samasung's high priority Bug
","
This phone has lots of cons that still need to be upgraded. The price range should be 16000 to 20000 only.Battery is average ( was draining fast even when not in use ), Fingerprint is slow, Display is somehow good.The most bug that I detected from samsung is that there's a call sound problem ( both on loud as well as ear ) from the day of purchase.When I was calling someone else, call sound was high, I tried to down call volume on both Loudspeaker and ear speaker, but that remained same i.e. high. The call sound is not getting down, I restarted phone but still same issue. Second issue was with mic, The other person on call could not hear my voice ( with focus mode On/Off ) properly. Every time my voice was so less to the receiver, so had to talk loudly.Both these two issues were resolved automatically after 2 days ( don't know how ) for a short time. Then again faced.Thought that it maybe occurred with some phone's setting, therefore I called customer care from samsung. He said that you've to call Amazon customer care ( the product you purchased from ).So I called to amazon customer care and told the issue, they checked and offered me to return the phone.I returned this product.Also I had purchased Samsung Galaxy M32 5G about 9 months ago. After 7 days of software update in current month the same above mentioned problem I'm facing. However this problem was resolved temporarily when I rebooted but after 1 day again the same issue.This is so high glitch on samsung that disappointed me.I gave one star rating.

Gone for a Samsung phone after using MI n Oppo for last 7yrs and the experience is worst.My previous Oppo k1 is still much better than this phone which I thought I am upgrading.- Battery backup is not that good- Phone performance is not upto the mark, response time is lagging, doesn't feel like 6gb ram- Camera quality definitely doesn't justify the price- Automatic brightness is fully responsive- Contacts getting deleted automatically- Call settings got changed automatically twice.Only one good thing that justify the price and brand name is the display but if u need an overall good phone. Pls go for MI, Oppo, Vivo.No customer service after so many complains and tweets ..no one is bothering to call alsoWorst Exp - This is my last gadget of Samsung

 I was planning not to go for samsung M53 initially but previously I was using galaxy f41 which was quite fine especially the battery life. Thought I can now trust samsung blindly after that. Not knowing I will be sorry for that. First of all they removed the adapter from the box and selling it separately before that they used to troll Apple for removing adapter from the box. But the real problem was when I bought the original samsung adapter for the same it was working fine for 10-12 days but after that it was not charging M53 but charging other phones, I thought my phone has some issue but to my surprise when I plug into other charger it was charging the real irony was it was not charging the phone for which it was bought for. Not only this this phone has serious battery drain issue, i always put on battery saver yet it hardly last for a day. Hanging is also there and when the battery completely drains you have to put it for 4-5 hours of charging. I don't care about the camera.

The product was delivered on 21st Novemeber'22. From the 23rd, mobile data, WiFi and Bluetooth stopped working completely. When I searched for the solution online, several others reported the same issues with no solution. Store-based sellers are not offering the model and its service for the same problems. We made the mistake of relying solely on amazon reviews, where these problems were not mentioned. Please refrain from buying this model.

Online only models are trash...Please do not but that

This phone is like Arrange marriage. you will get this phone online only that means you can not see it before you buy.The phone is a collection of extremely cheap parts. Samsung does not give the charger and that is OK as they told it upfront. But the cable sent with the phone is so bad that below the metro station a 60 rupees cable is better than what is hipped by Amazon.neither  front and rear the camera are upto the mark. The performance is also too slow. Do not misguide yourself by fancy specifications.The speaker are also very  normal and similar to the phone 8000 which you can not hear even when you are alone in room...I can challenge if the voice is clear and loud than my iphone5.All you can do after buying this Samsung phone is write a review on Amazon which neither Samsung not Amazon will bother. So my recommendation is do not play blind with these Online only models and better  buy what you see. Once you see what you like buy it from anywhereyou can google ""Samsung phone restart problem"". You can find yourself how people are victim of Samsung online only

the battery life is biggest turndown.. it is 5000ah.. but it barely makes it through the day even when GPS, Bluetooth are off through out the day.. the previous Samsung phone i was using (2 years old now) still can go for 2 days on a single charge even when it has less battery size than the new one's..at times the Wi-fi or Hotspot doesnt work.. it automatically gets turned off just a second or 2 after it turns on..for the first time i am disappointed with a Samsung phone..

Samsung phone have a poor Audio quality.

My Samsung Ph  have a poor audio quality from the time I purchased. couldn't return within the time as my mother was sick and  only son to take care of her. I reached out to Samsung store in Agra, they want me to leave the phone for 2-3 days and I don't have any spare phone. My request is can I return the ph and get the refund.

Very poor based on expectations
","
I used this device only for last 3 Days and based on it my feedback is1. WIFI - Very unstable and frequently  getting  disconnected  even my other device is connected  with same wifi.2. If I disabled  my WiFi and  trying to enable it again, It doesn't  enable  again and I need to reboot  my device3. SIM slot is not good, my micro SIM which get fit perfectly  does not fit in Samsung  M53 5G SIM slot and I have to push it to fit.4. Device  operation  based on 8Gb RAM is not upto mark when compared  with 8GB OPPO similar configuration device.Overall very average for me Samsung Galaxy M53 5G experience.

Battery sucks
","
M52 4g is better than this. As I have to charge it two times. Only camera quality is good. About 5g it is not launched in Pune's all areas. And 4g is enough to do your all activities. Don't buy it only for the sake of 5g. If you check 5g speed in spedtest it will consume 1gb of data only to check speed. So it's better to use 4g if you want to save data. I am mising my M52 for battery.

Hello everyone ,anyone who is planning to buy this phone please don't, the 108mp camera quality is very poor ,the performance is not upto mark ,oot platforms like hotstar doesn't work on it ,it got stuck many times while using ....please don't waste your money.....go for other brands in the same range oneplus or realme....

The phone is incompatible with BSNL sim. Samsung and Amazon should display this in the product profile. Sometimes, BSNL is the only service provider in your area and you cannot change it to any other service provider. Unaware people purchasing this phone feels cheated.

After long time I have decided to move from non-Chinese Mobile and I purchased Samsung M53. after buying this product I realized that this product is not having the basic functionality which I have been using since 2017. Can’t disconnect call by power button. Vibration when call connected and disconnected. Internet speed throughput Screenshot by Three finger moving on screen. Touch is not good. Some time multiple time has do move finger to receive call.Etc.

okay but not happy
","
phone okay, but not happy with (1) no audio jack port (2) no USB cable.The description says data cable, but both ends of the cable is C-type. This is good only for a phone to phone to connect. Not sure why phone to phone connection is mandatory as part of a phone purchase but a charging cable is not provided. One way, companies advocate to use an original adaptor and charging cable, but they instead provide only phone-to-phone connecting data transfer cable, which lets the users buy generic adaptors/charging cables. Samsung would have given a USB cable instead of a data transfer cable.And also, no Audio jack. The only option now is to go for a Bluetooth headset. I'm not a fan of Bluetooth headsets, but no option left now.

Don't buy Samsung Products.  They are not providing Charging Adapter.  There adapters are costly starting from 1300. (Oppo, Vivo Original Adapters starts from Rs.500). Adapters Quality is very bad.  My previous adapter is not working Samsung is not providing new as I lost my Adapter Box.  But I have the bill and it is under warranty but due to no Box they are not giving me the Adapter.

Bad to worst experience
","
First let me give a review of the mobile. I bought 8 and 128gb version. Overall is good. But it says it's fast charging but to charge it from 20% to 100% it's taking more than 2 hours. And with moderate use the battery will last for 30 odd hours, including the night time when we are not using it atall. Got the product on 30th October. After using for 2days suddenly the display was not working properly and after 10-15minutes it went totally blank. Now nothing is visible. Display totally gone.Tried to raise a replacement but as per Amazon a technical person will visit and check, and after his report they will proceed further. Ok, no issues with this, but the slot they gave is after 5days. They are delevering your product in 1day after you have ordered, but if there is any issue , them they are taking more than a week to replace it. That's not acceptable. Let's see what happens after the technician visit. Will provide the next updateGot the new phone after 10days. It was a very very bad experience while returning the product. Technician was scheduled after 3 days i raised request but no one showed up, got no calls from them. No one picked my call. I was told to reschedule it. I did for a time slot of 10 AM to 2PM (again after 48hours). Again no one came. I called to amazon customer and they told me to again reschedule. I dropped 3 mails escalating it. Then the techinicain called me and came after 6PM.I finally got the phone replaced on 10th November.The camera is not as good as it shoud be. Battery is bad. It takes more than 2.5 hours to full charge and stays for just over a day. (I dont play games on phone)

Conned by Samsung and AMAZON
","
The worst phone I've ever purchased!1.Battery: very poor, battery drains quickly and takes 2.5 hours to fully charge a phone in idle mode. False commitment of fast changing and useless 5000mah battery!2.The phone keeps getting hang, if using 3-4 apps simultaneously.3. The Camera is worse! Front cam is 3rd class. You have a better camera in M31 Samsung, which is cheaper than this.I had bought this phone on 13th sept 21, and had raised a replacement on 20th sept on this app, and chose 22nd as a date for technician visit. (I was given an option by amazon app from 21st to 25th).The technician didn't visit on 22nd and I called customer service dept to check about it. They informe that replacement window had already past on 21st, then I asked why was I given an option by this app for a technical visit on 22nd? Then he raised the same concern with his managet and said I'll be getting a reply soon.I didn't get any response, so I contacted the customer service dept again today, the higher dept to which this issue was raised has resolved it without informing and is not willing to talk to me.They have considered this phone fit without  physically verifying, and are not willing to communicate the application glitch which allowed me to book a technician visit which was on the next day of the last replacement day.Very good amazon! Thank you for this experience. This will be the last time I will be ordering an electronic item from you.

NO SL. NO. & IMEI NO. MENTIONED WITH THE INVOICE
","
The phone is not that best, but it is good. No issue with the Phone yet. But The problem is with the Seller & Amazon.And I feel this problem happens with every, different phones, selling by Amazon or the Seller.After delivery of this M32 5G phone, I didn't get any physical Invoice inside the delivery box. So I downloaded the invoice from Amazon app. After downloading it, I don't get the Serial no. & IMEI no. mentioned on the invoice, like how the offline shops mention every details about the phone on invoice .So, the problem is, whenever I visit service center for any service related to this phone, and the service center ask me to show the invoice for claiming warranty benifits.But, if the IMEI no. & Serial no. not mentioned on the invoice, then how the service center indentify that the invoice is registered for the same product.Problem from Amazon-After understanding the problem, immediately I contacted Amazon Customer Care by 06/11/2021. Then I explained all the issues to the customer care executive. So the executive asked me to provide all the images of IMEI no. & Serial No. mentioned on the mobile and box,  image of Amazon Delivery Box & the images of  invoice, pay slip.Then the customer care executive confirmed all the documents and raised a TT. Then told me to wait for 10 days, so, I'll get a new invoice with the IMEI & Serial no.After 9 days I contacted again. Then I got to know that, there's some error because of one image was not cleared. So, again I had to raise a new TT with new required documents and again have to wait for 10 days excluding holidays.They didn't even notify me about this error. If I didn't contact again, then I never got to know about this issue.So, If I am getting these much problem from  online Store. Then it's good to purchase from any offline store.And also asking to all the buyers to check with your invoices with any mobile phone you purchased online.

Problem phone quality

It's exactly 8 months since I bought this phone - It's showed up problems in audio- I couldn't hear caller or caller couldn't hear me. Around 30th August 2022, just 8 months after purchase, it stopped working completely, and I had to take it to the Samsung service center who told me the software update had corrupted my phone. I couldn't make or receive calls. My phone was reset and I had to reinstall all my apps. There is something drastically wrong either with the software or hardware (today it is 1st September 2022 and my phone is not working again). Please do not buy this phone - System UI stops responding, calls cannot be received or made, and apps crash.

Writing after 1 week.Major problems -1. fast battery discharge during internet browsing and doesn't last for 10 hours in the new phone.2. Over Heating problem during the online video (from youtube Facebook tweeter etc.) plays on 4G network.3. Does not support OTG USB storage device. Always promot to format your 3TB external hard disk. Do not buy, if you want to use external storage device via OTG adapter. Visited service center, but no success.Display is just ok with bigger screen size.Camera is ok.Phone is bulky but looking nice and sturdy.Sound is amazingly loud and clean without headphone.Fingerprint is very sensitive and sometimes irrigating too when it unlocks mistakenly. LoL.Overall a good phone to buy if you focus on technical configuration and security of data with Knox.Hopefully, next software update will fix the overheating problem and quick battery drainage.I will update the review after a while again.

I have purchased this product in the Amazon sale and had it delivered on 15th Oct 2021. So far these are my observations -1. The phone has amazing battery life2. Never heats up3. Calls are clearly audible4. Apps load fast5. Body looks and feels durableDislikes:1. Samsung, please understand my dog collar is longer than the USB cord. Suppose I am in a railway station and want to charge my phone from a plug point 4ft up without a dock, should I stand and hold the phone till 15W charges charges the device? What's with the short power cord?2. Screen in reading mode flickers. This is visible from day one. I am not initiating the return only because the device seems to hold up without malfunctioning. But in reading more, that flicker very much is visible.3. This is for buyers. If you're a camera person, straightaway skip this device. It has basic camera settings which was common 5 years ago. no aperture settings, shots look bland4. Is it too much to ask for a free screen guard with the phone that's charged a premium just for 5G bandwidth? Xiaomi is doing it and so are others5. Lower the cost as soon as possible. This phone is not worth 17000. I would put it in the ballpark of 12000-150006. Slowest and probably clumsiest face unlock - slow, lethargic, and not accurate. Probably because the camera isn't great

I bought a 8GB+128GB version. This 5000MAH battery is a useless one.On first day the phone was unplugged at 100% recharge at 7PM Saturday & battery drained to 25% by 11.30AM on sunday. The Battery Save mode was ON all the time. No calls made & most of the time the phone was lying in idle. Just 5 hours of light browsing was made.Again today unplugged by 5AM & by 4.30PM the battery drained to 48% with 3hrs of browsing usage, no calls made & kept idle most of the time.Yet another unreliable heavily speculated product from samsung india 💩🤯👎.My 5 year old Moto G5S+ 3000MAH battery is doing the same job after all these time of heavy use 👏👏 Kudos Motorola.Imagine what the gamers could use this useless phone of meger battery life.The so called 15W Fast charger is outdated & bulky, an useless accesorie. It takes 3 hours to full charge this handset. 🐢😤🤬If customers have the chance to get refund for this product as per 7 days replacement policy then undoubtedly everyone will choose that option & get rid of this sxxt phone.Most of the time the screen response is also cheap. So diificult or even non-responsive to copy OTP or other messages from the screen.

My first phone was a ZTE foldable CDMA since I opted for Tata Indicom. I loved it as it had so many features not available in the GSM phone that my friends had. When it stopped working, can you believe, I got a Huawei which was not so good but I used it for a year. Then I got a Samsung Wideo which accepted a CDMA SIM. Just loved it. Was heavy, bulky and odd but it made an impression whenever I used it. It was replaced by a candy bar Samsung. Both the device were replaced since the battery died. By this time CDMA handsets were rare the only one that accepted a CDMA SIM was the Honor Holly 3 Plus. It was okay. It accepted calls but CDMA data could not be activated. I replaced it with the Honor 9 Lite which was superb. Dropped it a couple of times but it still works. But it was time for a replacement. No Honor phone was available neither online nor on the shops. So I decided to buy from a brand I know. I had high hopes on this phone but it just wasn't as good as the Honor 9 Lite.

I give rating based on my experience.- I like the performance of this device which is very fast from my previous mobile- Not much satisfy with the display which have an TFT which experience like holding 10k budget mobile display experience as using previously AMoled Gorrilla Display which is far better then this one.- Dual aap feature have it but not have flexibily like 'Mi Mix 2' have like you can split / dual app apps to configure 2 accounts within single mobile- Charging not fast as i think or describe in the product description via online- Camera Quality not good and just put 48 MP tag onto box to get customer/buyerOverall experience I can say it ok worth for those looking device for performance wise not camera perspective.

Premium 5g phone

I just loved this phone using it now for about 20-25 days. Ordered it the same day of it’s launch and the best part received my phone within 24 hours . Qualities which are winning my heart are :1. It’s premium look give more class to the phone2. It’s a perfect size phone with 16.55 cm huge screen and still it’s a light weight phone very convenient to carry.3. Battery back up is amazing . It gives 24 hours or even more performance with wifi which is amazing .4. It’s quad camera setup gives you best pictures and again quality is just amazing .5. Selfie camera gives you perfect selfie which is 13MP.6. Lock censors work superb .7. Sound quality is amazing and very soothing to ears .8. Quality of screen is amazing.9. Performance is also great .10. Samsung has given all the premium feature in this range with perfect storage space.My reason for choosing this phone was it’s 5g 12 band network support but with this i got all the premium features. I am super happy with my choice . Thanks Samsung.

Smooth touch, future ready with 5g, sleek design, expandable memory option upto 1 tb.First impression of the phone is good,when used phone continuously for over 2 hrs, videos and downloads and battery went from 50% to 25%, so i expect it to run for a day with full charge. Fast charge is also excellent, but not like other fast charges available in market. Its 1 min for 1% approxThere has been a issue with the M series of phones with UI not responding and system hangs, but this processor on m32 seems to be strong and they have I reckon resolved the issue (recommended not to use Samsung in build apps much as they consume lot of data and there is unnecessary lots of cashed data stored).Camera is OK, but they have lot of features like macro cam for close up night mode and have snap chat filters pre-added on camera which makes it fun and handy.Overall a perfect buy at this price range.

The worst phone
","
Wifi automatically goes off suddenly, but wifi on my laptop still works. After 03 months of use calls are not connecting, before dialing it says call ended really the worst choice of phone. I should have sticked to Redmi or Vivo. I often remove my Sim and use it from my wife's vivo phone, her phone works well.

Bad to worst experience
","
First let me give a review of the mobile. I bought 8 and 128gb version. Overall is good. But it says it's fast charging but to charge it from 20% to 100% it's taking more than 2 hours. And with moderate use the battery will last for 30 odd hours, including the night time when we are not using it atall. Got the product on 30th October. After using for 2days suddenly the display was not working properly and after 10-15minutes it went totally blank. Now nothing is visible. Display totally gone.Tried to raise a replacement but as per Amazon a technical person will visit and check, and after his report they will proceed further. Ok, no issues with this, but the slot they gave is after 5days. They are delevering your product in 1day after you have ordered, but if there is any issue , them they are taking more than a week to replace it. That's not acceptable. Let's see what happens after the technician visit. Will provide the next updateGot the new phone after 10days. It was a very very bad experience while returning the product. Technician was scheduled after 3 days i raised request but no one showed up, got no calls from them. No one picked my call. I was told to reschedule it. I did for a time slot of 10 AM to 2PM (again after 48hours). Again no one came. I called to amazon customer and they told me to again reschedule. I dropped 3 mails escalating it. Then the techinicain called me and came after 6PM.I finally got the phone replaced on 10th November.The camera is not as good as it shoud be. Battery is bad. It takes more than 2.5 hours to full charge and stays for just over a day. (I dont play games on phone)

This is  worst phone ever I bought from Samsung. Battery is dead within 6 months of purchase.  Spending 20,000 approx for 6 months is a costly affair.  That means 3000/month from your pocket for 6 months for mobile phone only. I request not to buy Samsung mobile at all

Worst experience with the new phone not charging and no replacement

Conned by Samsung and AMAZON
","
The worst phone I've ever purchased!1.Battery: very poor, battery drains quickly and takes 2.5 hours to fully charge a phone in idle mode. False commitment of fast changing and useless 5000mah battery!2.The phone keeps getting hang, if using 3-4 apps simultaneously.3. The Camera is worse! Front cam is 3rd class. You have a better camera in M31 Samsung, which is cheaper than this.I had bought this phone on 13th sept 21, and had raised a replacement on 20th sept on this app, and chose 22nd as a date for technician visit. (I was given an option by amazon app from 21st to 25th).The technician didn't visit on 22nd and I called customer service dept to check about it. They informe that replacement window had already past on 21st, then I asked why was I given an option by this app for a technical visit on 22nd? Then he raised the same concern with his managet and said I'll be getting a reply soon.I didn't get any response, so I contacted the customer service dept again today, the higher dept to which this issue was raised has resolved it without informing and is not willing to talk to me.They have considered this phone fit without  physically verifying, and are not willing to communicate the application glitch which allowed me to book a technician visit which was on the next day of the last replacement day.Very good amazon! Thank you for this experience. This will be the last time I will be ordering an electronic item from you.

NO SL. NO. & IMEI NO. MENTIONED WITH THE INVOICE
","
The phone is not that best, but it is good. No issue with the Phone yet. But The problem is with the Seller & Amazon.And I feel this problem happens with every, different phones, selling by Amazon or the Seller.After delivery of this M32 5G phone, I didn't get any physical Invoice inside the delivery box. So I downloaded the invoice from Amazon app. After downloading it, I don't get the Serial no. & IMEI no. mentioned on the invoice, like how the offline shops mention every details about the phone on invoice .So, the problem is, whenever I visit service center for any service related to this phone, and the service center ask me to show the invoice for claiming warranty benifits.But, if the IMEI no. & Serial no. not mentioned on the invoice, then how the service center indentify that the invoice is registered for the same product.Problem from Amazon-After understanding the problem, immediately I contacted Amazon Customer Care by 06/11/2021. Then I explained all the issues to the customer care executive. So the executive asked me to provide all the images of IMEI no. & Serial No. mentioned on the mobile and box,  image of Amazon Delivery Box & the images of  invoice, pay slip.Then the customer care executive confirmed all the documents and raised a TT. Then told me to wait for 10 days, so, I'll get a new invoice with the IMEI & Serial no.After 9 days I contacted again. Then I got to know that, there's some error because of one image was not cleared. So, again I had to raise a new TT with new required documents and again have to wait for 10 days excluding holidays.They didn't even notify me about this error. If I didn't contact again, then I never got to know about this issue.So, If I am getting these much problem from  online Store. Then it's good to purchase from any offline store.And also asking to all the buyers to check with your invoices with any mobile phone you purchased online.

Problem phone quality

It's exactly 8 months since I bought this phone - It's showed up problems in audio- I couldn't hear caller or caller couldn't hear me. Around 30th August 2022, just 8 months after purchase, it stopped working completely, and I had to take it to the Samsung service center who told me the software update had corrupted my phone. I couldn't make or receive calls. My phone was reset and I had to reinstall all my apps. There is something drastically wrong either with the software or hardware (today it is 1st September 2022 and my phone is not working again). Please do not buy this phone - System UI stops responding, calls cannot be received or made, and apps crash.

Being an Samsung user always never seen any worst product of Samsung than this. I am full regretting. So now its your choice. Phone is heby & thikness is there. So dont buy.

Writing after 1 week.Major problems -1. fast battery discharge during internet browsing and doesn't last for 10 hours in the new phone.2. Over Heating problem during the online video (from youtube Facebook tweeter etc.) plays on 4G network.3. Does not support OTG USB storage device. Always promot to format your 3TB external hard disk. Do not buy, if you want to use external storage device via OTG adapter. Visited service center, but no success.Display is just ok with bigger screen size.Camera is ok.Phone is bulky but looking nice and sturdy.Sound is amazingly loud and clean without headphone.Fingerprint is very sensitive and sometimes irrigating too when it unlocks mistakenly. LoL.Overall a good phone to buy if you focus on technical configuration and security of data with Knox.Hopefully, next software update will fix the overheating problem and quick battery drainage.I will update the review after a while again.

Product quality could be better

I have purchased this product in the Amazon sale and had it delivered on 15th Oct 2021. So far these are my observations -1. The phone has amazing battery life2. Never heats up3. Calls are clearly audible4. Apps load fast5. Body looks and feels durableDislikes:1. Samsung, please understand my dog collar is longer than the USB cord. Suppose I am in a railway station and want to charge my phone from a plug point 4ft up without a dock, should I stand and hold the phone till 15W charges charges the device? What's with the short power cord?2. Screen in reading mode flickers. This is visible from day one. I am not initiating the return only because the device seems to hold up without malfunctioning. But in reading more, that flicker very much is visible.3. This is for buyers. If you're a camera person, straightaway skip this device. It has basic camera settings which was common 5 years ago. no aperture settings, shots look bland4. Is it too much to ask for a free screen guard with the phone that's charged a premium just for 5G bandwidth? Xiaomi is doing it and so are others5. Lower the cost as soon as possible. This phone is not worth 17000. I would put it in the ballpark of 12000-150006. Slowest and probably clumsiest face unlock - slow, lethargic, and not accurate. Probably because the camera isn't great

An another Disappointing product from Samsung.

I bought a 8GB+128GB version. This 5000MAH battery is a useless one.On first day the phone was unplugged at 100% recharge at 7PM Saturday & battery drained to 25% by 11.30AM on sunday. The Battery Save mode was ON all the time. No calls made & most of the time the phone was lying in idle. Just 5 hours of light browsing was made.Again today unplugged by 5AM & by 4.30PM the battery drained to 48% with 3hrs of browsing usage, no calls made & kept idle most of the time.Yet another unreliable heavily speculated product from samsung india 💩🤯👎.My 5 year old Moto G5S+ 3000MAH battery is doing the same job after all these time of heavy use 👏👏 Kudos Motorola.Imagine what the gamers could use this useless phone of meger battery life.The so called 15W Fast charger is outdated & bulky, an useless accesorie. It takes 3 hours to full charge this handset. 🐢😤🤬If customers have the chance to get refund for this product as per 7 days replacement policy then undoubtedly everyone will choose that option & get rid of this sxxt phone.Most of the time the screen response is also cheap. So diificult or even non-responsive to copy OTP or other messages from the screen.

My first phone was a ZTE foldable CDMA since I opted for Tata Indicom. I loved it as it had so many features not available in the GSM phone that my friends had. When it stopped working, can you believe, I got a Huawei which was not so good but I used it for a year. Then I got a Samsung Wideo which accepted a CDMA SIM. Just loved it. Was heavy, bulky and odd but it made an impression whenever I used it. It was replaced by a candy bar Samsung. Both the device were replaced since the battery died. By this time CDMA handsets were rare the only one that accepted a CDMA SIM was the Honor Holly 3 Plus. It was okay. It accepted calls but CDMA data could not be activated. I replaced it with the Honor 9 Lite which was superb. Dropped it a couple of times but it still works. But it was time for a replacement. No Honor phone was available neither online nor on the shops. So I decided to buy from a brand I know. I had high hopes on this phone but it just wasn't as good as the Honor 9 Lite.

I give rating based on my experience.- I like the performance of this device which is very fast from my previous mobile- Not much satisfy with the display which have an TFT which experience like holding 10k budget mobile display experience as using previously AMoled Gorrilla Display which is far better then this one.- Dual aap feature have it but not have flexibily like 'Mi Mix 2' have like you can split / dual app apps to configure 2 accounts within single mobile- Charging not fast as i think or describe in the product description via online- Camera Quality not good and just put 48 MP tag onto box to get customer/buyerOverall experience I can say it ok worth for those looking device for performance wise not camera perspective.

It gives 24 hours or even more performance with wifi which is amazing .4. It’s quad camera setup gives you best pictures and again quality is just amazing .5. Selfie camera gives you perfect selfie which is 13MP.6. Lock censors work superb .7. Sound quality is amazing and very soothing to ears .8. Quality of screen is amazing.9.

There are many hidden problems in this phone.
","
This phone is overpriced for even discounted price (12,999/- for 6 GB variant). I purchased it because of past good experience with Samsung (Galaxy On6) but this phone cannot match the legacy. Samsung has done too much  unnecessary cost cutting on this phone.Camera: It has an average camera. It clicks decent photos and records good videos up to 4K 30fps, fhd 60. Only the main 50 MP sensor is usable, all others are present just for count. Camera has serious bug that it captures washed out colours if its AI detects a human face while using flash. If we remove human from frame, it captures just fine colours. Also, colours are just fine while clicking without flash.Front camera is pathetic from today's standard, it will just get you with video calls and nothing more, do not expect to use it for selfies with clarity. I do not click many pictures so I am okay with its camera.You can see this issue in the attached images, both the images were captured in low light with flash, the first one came out fine with colours close to actual object while the second one has completely washed out colours because the AI in phone detected human there. This unnecessary processing ruins the joy and there is no option in camera settings to turn this off. I have spent many hours trying to avoid this with different combinations of camera settings but it cannot be turned off. This bug might be embedded deep in the phone hardware as even third party camera apps ( I tried with OpenCamera) also give the same results.Battery : It can last for around 2 days with light to medium usage. It struggles to last one full day with high usage. Exynos 1280 is not efficient considering it is 5nm chipset. Also, the phone gets warm even with normal usage ( browsing etc) and gets somewhat hot during gaming.Idle battery drain is around 8-10% per night.It charges from 8% to 100% in 4:50 hours with 5 watt charger.With 7.5w (5v 1.5a) charger, it takes around 2:55 hours.Charges in around 2:15 hours with 15 watt charger (shows as fast charging).With 25 watt charger, the phone shows as super fast charging and charges from 5% to 100% in 1:24 hours.Display : Display seems smooth with 120 Hz, obviously not punchy as super amoled but it is okay and has good brightness for sunlight use and sufficiently low brightness for comfortable night use. Viewing angles are good. I did not face any issue with display and am okay with it.Buggy Auto brightness: Samsung has a habit of using cheap virtual sensors on its devices. This phone has virtual light sensors which is just a software solution to set screen brightness according to light present in room and using front camera as the light source. But this is seriously buggy in this phone, the phone does not understand difference between complete dark and dimly lit room. So, it will apply same brightness settings to both of these situations resulting unnecessarily bright screen in dark and uncomfortably dim screen in dimly lighted room. This sensor works poorly in outdoor as well. Most of the time, the brightness it applies to screen is not adequate.Software and UI: Samsung had installed may bloatware apps which are removable, One UI as everyone knows, is pretty user friendly. So, that is okay, however, Samsung should mention that this phone does not support some of the features such as S secure, bixby routines and sound assistant which are useful for some. Otherwise software experience is good, lag free.WiFi: It supports 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi at 1x1. So max of 72 mbps in 2.4 ghz mode and max 433 mbps in 5 ghz mode. This is the most basic wifi configuration possible. It can share wifi over hotspot which is nice. Although basic, wifi will not give any issue and has good range. So, wifi is okay.Bluetooth: I did not test bluetooth range but found it sufficient for my use. It can connect to two different  devices simultaneously. However, can play music in one device only. Did not find any issue with bluetooth.Mobile network: It has good 5g support with 12 bands but supports only 1 5g sim at a time. If we set one of the sims to 5g mode, the other one drops to 4g/3g/2g mode.It supports carrier aggregation and when tested, it was working with 3 band carrier aggregation with Jio.Call clarity is good and it can record calls without announcing to other person. virtual proximity sensor is not too bad.Fingerprint reader: For this price, the performance of side mounted fingerprint reader is good enough.We can register up to 3 fingerprints only which is limiting and not appreciated, at least 5 should be given.Face unlock: I guess it has AI based face unlock which works good even in low light condition. Although I do not know how secure it is.Storage and Memory: It has 6 to 8 GB of Lpddr4x RAM which is good for this price.128 GB storage used is UFS 2.1 which is not justified at this price in 2022 and lacks in performance when compared to UFS 2.2, apps take more time to install.Gaming: I installed call of duty mobile and it allowed settings up to medium graphics with very high frame rate and low graphics with max frame rate. In both settings, game was lag free and frame rate was always below 60 fps. So below average gaming. However, I do not play games, so, did not test with other games and do not care about gaming performance.Multimedia: Display quality is okay and single bottom firing speaker is average and audio from headset jack is fine, no complaints here.The chipset used in this phone supports h.264, h.265 video codecs only and does not support VP9 and AV1 codecs which is the most annoying downside. This means that it can play youtube only till 1080p and not in 2k or 4k because youtube supports h.264 up to 1080p only and we need vp9 and av1 support if we want to play higher resolution videos and if in future youtube removes h.264 support then this phone will not be able to play youtube at all. This is a very serious issue with this device. In future, all the streaming services will eventually switch to vp9 and av1 codecs as they provide better streaming efficiency and are royalty free, but as this phone does not support those, we cannot say this will be good for multimedia in future. So, 0 points for this in multimedia.Also, if we play youtube videos in browser like brave, it runs in software acceleration mode ( again, due to lack of vp9 and av1 capability) which loads up cpu and drains battery fast. Use youtube in either Youtube app or Newpipe to prevent unnecessary battery drain (as these apps play videos with hardware acceleration, which saves power). All this nonsense applies to other OTT apps (Hotstar, Prime etc) as well as almost all of them use VP9 codec for streaming which this phone plays in software mode, which shoot up the cpu usage and causes fast battery drain ( around 15-18% per hour).GPS and navigation : Works just fine. Has compass support.Pros:Two promised android updates and 4 years of security updates.Sufficiently good display with high refresh rate, feels really smooth.Good audio, WiFi and Bluetooth.dedicated memory card slot.base variant with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage which is good.Cons:Samsung cheaping out with no charger/cover/screen protector in box while competitors provide those.5g on single sim only. Competitors provide dual 5g in even cheaper phones.inferior UFS 2.1 storage is not good at this price, UFS 2.2 should be there.only up to 3 fingerprints.Buggy camera algorithm.cheap virtual proximity sensor.buggy camera light sensor.Exynos 1280 chipset claims to be having 5nm lithography which is good on paper, but in reality, its efficiency is on par with some 12-14 nm chipset and it heats under general use. Also, I don't understand why Samsung had to omit useful VP9 and AV1 codec which wouldn't even have costed them more as they are royalty free and Mediatek Dimensity 920 with same Mali G68 GPU supports those codecs. This has resulted the phone to be not able to play 4K and 2K resolutions on youtube.No HDR playback support.

Worst possible phone at this price segment
","
Please see screenshots.Storage: Storage speed test in Antutu seems to get score of 28000. When I asked customer chat in Samsung portal, they said it is EMMC 5.1.Battery: is 5830 mAh, not exactly 6000 mAh. Better not to cheat customers by marketing a 5830 mAh battery as 6000 mAh. Instead, give an actual 6000 mAh battery.Display: seems okay, but has some dark borders at all edges of display. Borders are thicker than other phones.Camera: at low light does not identify objects well.Overall, Samsung should work on giving more value at same price by providing either UFS 2.1/3.1 storage or amoled display.Battery life: doesn't come 2 days with moderate usage. Exynos processors need to efficient not only in terms of nanometers, but also in software-hardware optimization, which seems to be lacking.Will add updates if I find any after few weeks.Edit on 23 April 2022: Light sensor is not working correctly and quickly, and proximity sensor is working very slowly. Display is not visible under sunlight.Edit on 2 May 2022: Added more screenshots. Light sensor is not identified. One of the apps shows EMMC 5.1 as storage type. Feeling my money got wasted.Edit on 13 May 2022: Touch response and phone response both are slow due to EMMC 5.1 storage. At least they could have given UFS 2.1 for INR 15,999. Both 50 MP and front 8 MP cameras have the worst clarity and quality. Please refrain from buying this device. Too many compromises are done in this phone.Edit on 20 May 2022: There have been many fake reviews seen, probably to improve the rating and feedback. Do a comprehensive and deep research before deciding to buy. This phone is not at all recommended with the worst hardware configuration - No charger, worst cameras and proximity, light sensors.

Few drops of water makes you regret
","
So I bought this phone recently and while travelling on a bike few drops of rain might have entered the bag in which this phone was kept and next day screen started to act weird. There is not a micro level of water protection in the phone. The samsung store charged a hefty sum for the screen change and I still regret my decision to buy this phone, lured by good specs on the screen where the basic things are a miss.

Messaging, payment apps, office applications do not work
","
Hello everyone,I bought this phone because my previous phone completely broke.But been having problems with payment apps and office apps.Upon digging/Googling I understood that it is because messaging doesn't work on M series phones. We cannot save the messaging centre manually,  and it is probably a bug.I tried calling Samsung Customer,  I am hoping I will get a call back from them in a couple of hours and hopefully a fix.Truly truly disappointed, not what I expected from a 20000+ phone.Update:Got a callback next day from Samsung,  they want me to do a bunch of trouble shooting steps. If those don't work, I am to go to the nearest service centre.Please be wary before buying this phone.

Worst and laggy phone i ever used in my life. Also Samsung site got better rate than this
","
I made purchase then noticed 2k less on Samsung website. Anyway it’s my mistake so not returning it. Hope this will be fast one as it’s 6gb ram.After couple of days usage i am feeling bad on this purcgase. 6GB ram but i am not happy with speed of this. Skype too slow.4 cameras but its useless for taking photos of real use. If you just want to share it on social media then it looks awesome. But if i want to take a product photo and try to edit in photoshop its no where near to usable qualityAs its slow you definitely need tripod to get photos proper.Usage reviewIt's the worst phone i ever used and 6gb or 8gb ram is just a trap. It's useless as this phone is dead slow. If I click something i get something else. That kind of slow it is. Chinese brands with 2gb ram and below 8k budget got 100x speed  than this. To type this review it took me lot of time becaus it's issues.

My 4 year old Realme 1 is working much faster than this. Become worst just after android 13 upgrade. 6, 128 GB phone working like a 2, 16 GB phone. It's performance is worst may be due to exynose processor. I don't recommend. Better go for realme, redmi, OnePlus, iqoo etc.

Average performer
","
Recommended for house wives and mothers who use phone moderately (i mean, this phone is not good for heavy users).Reason for 2 star rating is that they didn't provide a charger and with the charger which i got separately outside, I'm facing slow charging speed and heating issues. Mobile company giants like samsung and apple are not providing chargers in the name of becoming ECO FRIENDLY, but doing this only adds to carbon footprint by these :1]new charger means new cover and new box for that charger2] additional new box and packaging material for shipping (@ online orders)3] additional fuel consumption by vehicles transporting the charger4]additional invoice means additional paper5] if the received piece is defective or not upto the mark, returns and replacements add more to all these.THIS BETTER STOP NOW.this new trend is as annoying as it's impracticality.If not for their charger feud, i would've given this 4-5 stars.PS: display is a drawback for this mobile but in the long run, you wouldn't notice any difference. So, i guess LCD display isn't much of a problem.

Call recording does not work when WIFI calling is enabled
","
I only bought Samsung for this particular feature ie, Call recording without the second party not getting to know I am recording the call. After the Android 11 release, every other phone company using Google dialer has to mandatory announce the call recording is in progress to comply with the GDPR laws of Europe. Only Samsung makes their dialers and does not use Google dialers by default, so they somehow circumvent this issue.But they did half-assed work.WIFI calling is an essential feature in the new phones. The network inside the homes is terrible in cities due to tower shortages. But when you enable the WIFI calling, this phone does not record, not manually nor automatically. Never knew this problem existed; even my old Oppo A31(android 9) has this call recording feature even if the WIFI calling is enabled. All Samsung phones, including this one, do not work. The Samsung forums have people complaining about this issue for the past two years, and still, there is no workaround from Samsung.I did not know about this problem. Otherwise, I would not have gone with this phone.Another issue, as everyone complained, is the missing adapter. It looks like Samsung wants to fool Indians by selling phones without adapters. I got fooled. It is going to give a bad reputation to Samsung. How good is a phone without an adapter? It's like buying a car without wheels.The phone is super heavy. It's not suitable for people with weak hands and muscular issues. Good as a hands-on weapon.Even though call recording has a severe shortcoming, the quality is good. It can be used as an everyday working phone with sufficient memory and storage.

Only for elderly people

Honest ReviewI bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly. Experience -1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.The voice focus function is good.5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.7. There are some really small good featureslike samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.No charger

 Fab phone...the display is not ambled but didn't bother me due to quality... it is super fast.  I bought the 8gb version. The look and back is stylish. It is light weight although not very slim from sides.The camera looks good with all the premium features like slo mo, portrait, macro, hyperlapse etc. The performance is super smooth. The new thing is side button finger print sensor. Easy to open. Face recognition is good. Rest will post after using some time. But in this cost, it looks super worth the money. Go for it!Edit:I am surprised why is everyone talking about charger.. we have n number of chargers floating in our houses from older phones and it is a good way of reducing e waste. Also, if they would give the charger and headset, the cost goes high. So may be Samsung can create it as an option for people who want to buy with extra cost. The features of the phones are premium, except Amoled display, but look at the cost.. I think it is a bargain.The phone is fantastic. I have been using since 3 days now, excellent battery backup- 2 days with normal usage (I don't play games), super smooth and fast, and 5g is awesome (use with wifi).Edit:Major audio bug that I am facing in this phone. I requested for a replacement and guess what the replacement phone has that issue too.As soon as I put an audio app to back ground...let's say I am listening a song or an ebook via headphone and I go to home screen, it creates a loud screach and very very loud voice. U will have to take off ur earphone.The biggest issue is the replacement didn't solve this problem. I would have to go to Samsung now. :(Don't buy. Not worth it. I was using M20 for 3 years before this and it was clearly better.

Samsung has been pushing few apps being installed behind the software update, Samsung is forcefully installs these apps on our phone without our permission as part of their some deal with these app developers.This is really Annoying specially for elders who has no clue about thisBattery life is good if you don't watch any videos, if you start watching videos battery will be drained in a hour or soAlso basic feature like App Lock is missing (which comes in other android phones).

M33 5G THE UNDERDOG YOU WILL LOVE
","
Well i am writing the review after using this phone for nearly 10 days , we my experience is as follow1.OFFER HELP ME BUYINGi purchased this device in Rs 9400 in Amazon summer sale ( including all offers) refer image attached , So for me in this price range i think this is the best what i can get2. WHY  M33 5GWell This is my first Samsung device  in 10 years of using smartphone  & before buying there are lot of negative notion against this device  but as amount and offers are tempting so i decided to buy the device , BUT i can say there is lot of noticeable difference between this Samsung device and others from MI , POCCO'S & REAL ME (BEEFORE I HAVE REALME 6) well the difference are as follows2.1. the screen :- Lots of you tubers and electronic gurus told the screen is bad , etc. etc . but  as per my usage the screen is awesome not comparable to AMOLED but better than  all other group IPS panels , i like the 120 HZ scroll feature is great .2.2. Software:- In my home there are lots of MI, Realme devices and we all have one complaint in common that is bloatware, unwanted messages due to which whole phone experience go to waste coupled with Bugs in UI, So this time after buying Samsung M33 i get rid of lot of bloatware's and unwanted advertisement2.3 Built :- built is simple and solid , i like the Rugged built with Gorilla Glass 5 protection , Over all it is good2.4. Network Connectivity :- Samsung is  very old company in telecom  as compared to these new Age smart phone manufacturer, and believe me Samsung device are far far better in connectivity as compared to other my all old devices from chinsed manufacturer always struggle with network and connectivity issues  but this device is lot better if your prime aim is to communicate and do calls2.5. sound & speaker:- There is feature of clear sound in the phone ,which is good for long time calls & speaker is loud enough for You tube content consumption2.6. Knox security :- It is very good added advantage for secure online payment , as I am deal high on online payment then this feature have very required security for day to day money transfer2.7. Battery & Processor - Processor is snappy and highly responsive and combined with 6000mha battery due to this the device is long lasting hours of usageConclusion :- I am experienced  smartphone user and always emphasis that one should buy phone as per his  or her prime requirements and I found this Samsung device M33 a well balanced  smart phone and will recommend others to buy one because the There is no alternative to network connectivity and Knox security if we compared to other devicesTHANK YOU

In 10 min, there is no display on phone. Assuming low battery, we have connected for charging. After 1 hour also, no display on.Took it to service center. No damage identified on the outside. There is a signal link break between display and motherboard. I guess it is the wire bus.It does not come under warranty it seems. They claim that it must have happened because of phone fall on the backside. Boss ! ThERE is no FALL. No hint of damage on the external, buy I side online broke-- and no warranty!!!

BAD EXPERIENCEI would write not about product but my horrible experience,so that someone gets alarmed before u buy electronic items.High value items like this are non returnable. I didnt know the rule change. Accidentally my son ordered for my wife ,and just after i received the packet i thought to get a higher version phone. Didn't open the pack, hoping to return or get it replaced for another model.But to my horror, i found that Amazon has cleverly removed the return option. So I tried for a replacement, but i saw it can be replaced with same model. So even if,i didnt open the pack,i was forced to use it. It's a great lesson learnt.

I have shifted to samsung because I want to try a new brand. But samsung totally disappointed  me. Don't know about other samsung phones but m32 is just bogus.1. Bogus touch screen. MI touch screen is much better than this in this price range.2. Phone is very slow for normal operation also. Just forget about gaming. 6gb ram is just a pure joke.3. 50 mega pixek camera is another joke. MI camera is better than this.So not a value for money is you think  quality.

It seems this model is being built from recycled electronics.First phone was returned becoz of worst wifi connectivity and Bluetooth.Second phone is creating lots of issues on wifi. Moreover, samsung phones are set to work for 2 years or less than that..If you are ready to visit service center within 1month of purchase. You are welcome to buy this phone

Purchased on 24th Sep.Delivered on 27th Sep..Return window closes on 3rd OCT.ISSUE HAPPENED ON 10TH OCT.WE WERE DOING INSTAGRAM REEL, BATTERY WAS AT 15%. Kept the phone aside. In 10 min, there is no display on phone. Assuming low battery, we have connected for charging. After 1 hour also, no display on.Took it to service center. No damage identified on the outside. There is a signal link break between display and motherboard. I guess it is the wire bus.It does not come under warranty it seems. They claim that it must have happened because of phone fall on the backside. Boss ! ThERE is no FALL. No hint of damage on the external, buy I side online broke-- and no warranty!!! Shame on samsung!!!I got this Phoenix for 11,000 INR and now for replacing a broken wire, they are asking 6000/Samsung wake up !!Amazon wakeup !!!

Disclaimer: Don't buy, waste of money!!!

Product become very slow after 2 months of usage only. Eventhough my phone is loaded with very minimal apps and there is more than 50% of space is available. You can with some other redmi or realme phone for this price range. Samsung is not maintaining their trust on low budget models ...

Slow performance, not value for money product

The phone is extremely slow to respond.I can clearly feel a delay of 1 to 3 seconds in response, especially when clicking the camera shutter button or opening apps.I had M31 earlier and that's still responding faster than this M32.

"
Didn't meet expectations
","
Sometimes it heats up and sometimes it works slowly because of the mediatek processor..Sometimes calls doesn't connect despite the signals..Calls are connecting when the phone is restarted..Not Satisfied with this device..

Frauded by Amazon & Samsung

Very Pathetic service from Amazon,No inspection engineer came & no refund for defective M32, Samsung is total fraud in Low & Mid Range Mobiles. Consumer court is the solutions.

I purchased this phone on 16999 from Amazon by exchange .but I did not find any quality as per this high price.1. Phone touchscreen is very slow and sometimes hangs stop working.2 while viewing YouTube the voice is not coming clear sometimes voice going up and down ,  microphone and speaker of this phone is not up to the mark even I should say worst. Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more  photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than  my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company

Very poor product. Just forget about the Camera quality. A lot of noise and color variation you will find in the images taken out with this. Especially the front camera, a cheap webcam can take a much better image than this. Just see the noise, brightness issue and color variation in the shirt shown in the image(shirt is a very light colour one but it is coming entirely different in this image and no details of it). Camera is also very laggy in preview mode.Beware that this product once purchased can't be returned or replaced. Amazon will right away deny that mentioning about their policies. Think twice before buying this. In terms of other performance it is somewhat ok but not justifying the amount that we pay for. There are better alternatives available for 19k available from other manufacturers. Quality of the product is not at all justifiable from this price point.

Don't go with only the written specs and compare with cheaper fones, quality matters a lot! Trust me.On paper, it is inferior in specs as compared to other brands, and other samsung online-only phones, but This fone is far better in quality than any fone I have used so far. (I have almost always used mid range fones)Pros:1.Good battery life and outstanding stand-by battery ( u sleep at 60%, u get 60% wen u wake up)2. Reception Including Bluetooth is excellent.(I can use use my Bluetooth earphones from next house also! )3. Very premium feel and very smooth touch.4. I don't know how, but this tft display is much clearer and better than many amoled displays of the same range .5. 3yrs of android updates and 4yrs of software updates!6. Samsung charger In the box, u like the online only variants(though it's a 15w charger)Cons:1. Little overpriced maybe...1000to1500 rs, but it compensates for it in the luxury feel, tough built and gorilla5 glass.2. Takes longer to charge since it's upto 25w charging, but I charge the fone once in 2 days, coz it consumes very less power, even while playing gamesDon't listen to the so called you tubers tho are not the real experts on the matter. If you have been using Chinese fones like redmi/realmi/oppo etc then u will surely enjoy this fone , it's smoothness and the premium feel/looks.

Little overpriced maybe...1000to1500 rs, but it compensates for it in the luxury feel, tough built and gorilla5 glass.2. Takes longer to charge since it's upto 25w charging, but I charge the fone once in 2 days, coz it consumes very less power, even while playing gamesDon't listen to the so called you tubers tho are not the real experts on the matter. If you have been using Chinese fones like redmi/realmi/oppo etc then u will surely enjoy this fone , it's smoothness and the premium feel/looks.

Camera quality not acceptable at all.
","
Very poor product. Just forget about the Camera quality. A lot of noise and color variation you will find in the images taken out with this. Especially the front camera, a cheap webcam can take a much better image than this. Just see the noise, brightness issue and color variation in the shirt shown in the image(shirt is a very light colour one but it is coming entirely different in this image and no details of it). Camera is also very laggy in preview mode.Beware that this product once purchased can't be returned or replaced. Amazon will right away deny that mentioning about their policies. Think twice before buying this. In terms of other performance it is somewhat ok but not justifying the amount that we pay for. There are better alternatives available for 19k available from other manufacturers. Quality of the product is not at all justifiable from this price point.

Battery life is superb.Look is good.Other than that connectivity issue-the other person is always unable to hear clearly whenever I make a call(Only WhatsApp calls help).Camera is not that good. You can only expect good pictures when you have good lighting, otherwise forget about good pictures during the night or low light area.Sensor is moody, if it wants to work it'll work if it doesn't wants to, then even after multiple attempts, it'll not read the finger print.Processor is bit slow.  Sometimes gets stuck for several minutes.Overall-Not worth the penny.

Don't go with only the written specs and compare with cheaper fones, quality matters a lot! Trust me.On paper, it is inferior in specs as compared to other brands, and other samsung online-only phones, but This fone is far better in quality than any fone I have used so far. (I have almost always used mid range fones)Pros:1.Good battery life and outstanding stand-by battery ( u sleep at 60%, u get 60% wen u wake up)2. Reception Including Bluetooth is excellent.(I can use use my Bluetooth earphones from next house also! )3. Very premium feel and very smooth touch.4.

I had to replace the phone since it was stopping while playing videos and the touch wasn't working. I got a replacement phone and it has the same problems though touch is slightly better.

But the assigned technical agent left Amazon for more than year and I ended up co-ordinating with  CS support and that person.Again the next person avoided a personal visit and put me on a Minspect app and verified for few min. (Worst app at all and they promised for a personal visit but ended up on-call check)Again after a new call to the support team, they have agreed for a refund and asked me to update my pan card.

mediocre laggy device
","
I bought this for my dad who is currently using M21 1st edition. Let me list down pros and consPros:1. 6000 mah battery2. Branded device. Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.3. Charger included in box (15w)Cons:1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery3.  very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.

battery life, fingerprint reader are good. But there is lot of noise while taking foto in low light condition.One must also look the performance of the device. For the price range it's ok but there is drop in performance and frame rate while scrolling through Google news and youtube. Not only these there are lots of lag while using. I have been using m13 4g for 7 days. If you want to buy then go for the M13 5g model which offer more fluidity since it runs on MT D700 (7nm technology) which is more better performance  the exynos 850. Think carefully while buying.

Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.

Device performance

battery life, fingerprint reader are good. But there is lot of noise while taking foto in low light condition.One must also look the performance of the device. For the price range it's ok but there is drop in performance and frame rate while scrolling through Google news and youtube. Not only these there are lots of lag while using. I have been using m13 4g for 7 days. If you want to buy then go for the M13 5g model which offer more fluidity since it runs on MT D700 (7nm technology) which is more better performance  the exynos 850. Think carefully while buying.

WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT
","
Purchase this or anything on Amazon at your own risk, customer support is not going to help.My unit had a physical defect, gaps on the sides from the back panel and it's a serious issue considering the phone is ip68 rated (water resistant) and this gap can cause water damage. Poor quality control as I saw some other customers reporting same issue and some units also getting water damage and then Samsung can't help there.First, they can't replace directly now. Some technician will visit and verify the issue however no one called or showed up and then I get an email saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Support Reps on chat are disconnecting the chat saying they can't do anything, there's a different team for these issues which is rude. It's been more than 24 hours and no one joined that chat and yet I was told ""I have option to keep this chat window open so have you can get connect with your concern team""Lastly, cherry on top is that they CAN'T change the address for the Technician's visit even if you're not at the same location where the order was delivered. Due to this, I had to wait 4 hours on a different location for the Technician's visit and no one came except for the email later saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Basically, you're on own after purchasing from Amazon. Think before making bigger purchases.Update: Still unresolved and denied further supportAfter a week of back and forth, finally a replacement was created however it wasn't delivered. For 5 days straight, it kept saying ""Now arriving today"" and ""Rescheduled"" and it's just stuck there.After countless hours with ~15 support and escalation agents (they all have technical issues when I ask a question), one of them canceled the order in hurry and now they can't create a new replacement order. Asking me to return the defective phone and place a new order which is by paying 6500/- more whereas I placed the order on sale for 23.5k. One agent promised that he'll refund the new order but he disconnected the chat and the next agent is not respective that offer.Currently, I'm stuck with the defective phone and support team disconnected the chat even while talking and said we can't help you anymore. That Agent also sent an email with numerous links pushing the survey links to bottom and interestingly, he modified the survey URL's domain from Amazon.in to Amazon.co.uk to avoid feedback and this was by the either by the Escalations or Leadership team.Not just the frontline Support team, Escalations and Leadership teams are also irresponsible and have such unethical and unprofessional behavior. Not to mention, no one wants to check the previous chats, you have to repeat every single thing all over again and I've done this for 2 weeks with more than 15 Agents.Next: I'm taking this social media and consumer forums.

Very very IMP to read if you are planning to buy S20 FE 5G - Known display issue
","
Ever wondered why this model is also sold a large numbers which are refurbished? Thats because it has a display issue which are noticed within one month of purchase and if such phone arrives at service centre they replace them with another one with new phone if bought from offline store (if bought from amazon then they will repair only and you need to live with it). Then samsung repairs the faulty phone and sells as refurbished by the dealers. Otherwise such a latest model wouldnt have so many refurbished phones.Now below is my purchase experience.I bought this phone on 11th Aug 22 and on 19th Aug the display automatically stopped working. Since Amazon provides replacement for 7 days so I couldnt replace - I dont consider myself as unlucky because its the problem with most of the Samsung S20 FE 5G models, and if you go to Samsung customer review site you can see many customers complaining about it globally. Also if you visit Samsung Service Centre in India and just sit there for few hours then high chances 1-2 persons would come with this issue.I mailed to Samsung, Amazon and requested for replacement since it was a manufacturing issue but no one listened, I twitted but no help - just some usual response came from both Samsung and Amazon. Amazon said since 7 days passed so they cant help. Samsung said they dont replace online bought products although they have 14 days replacement policy but that is only for offline products.I was frustrated and raised greivance at consumer forum but there also Samsung said they cant replace the product since its purchased from Amazon. And after no help I asked Samsung Service Centre to repair the product to which they said they need to check if it was a physical damange or liquid damage etc. and they first scared me saying it looks like I messed with the product but later agreed when managed to convince them sitting the whole day in the service centre. now they are saying the screen isnt available or they are not able to order. I am holding the dead phone for almost a month now. If you are planning to buy this phone then consider yourself lucky and learn from my pathetic experience and just dont buy this phone. Better buy any other phone but not Samsung's.

A Phone with known screen black dead problem! Stay away from Samsung.
","
I bought this phone with high hopes, it worked fine for few days, but within 2 weeks screen went black. On checking the samsung forums and amazon reviews, I understood this is a known problem and there are many customers, probably almost everyone facing this same issue who got it online. Now probably its my turn to go to service centre. I am really surprised to see Samsung neglecting customers that too S series buyers. There are some cases where consumers have raised cases vs Samsung but no response. I sincerely request Amazon to stop selling such items with known issues, as they spoil your reputation. I know Samsung is a big giant, so was Micromax and Lava at one point. We trust Amazon on their reliability and quality, but such incidents spoil the whole experience. I already told my friend to buy offline and go for Oneplus as don't want him to face this challenge.One day Samsung will learn and pay for their ignorance towards customers like us. Now there are thousands who will never buy Samsung just because of their experience with S20 FE 5G. A sensible company will recall such products from consumers or provide them a permanent fix.I too pledge never to buy a Samsung mobile in future.Update: Visited the Service centre and they replaced the display and returned the mobile same day in few hours. I have not got extended warranty as am skeptical how long the display will last, so better to cover for 2 years. Post which we can say that investment was spent over.The only good thing is Service centre had spare display ready(probably anticipating all S20 users will visit at some point). The Person ahead of me was also visiting the centre with same issue of same model, so its evident that its mass batch issue. Ideally Samsung should recall and withdraw such products from market. Anyway probably Samsung know better what to be done, but my next mobile will never be Samsung.

Don't buy this model
","
Please do not buy samsung phones. I have bought Samsung S20 FE 5G phone before 20 days. My phone display has stopped working working now. I have seen many videos on your tube then I realized that it is common problem in this phone. Samsung service center is accepting it is manufacturing defect. However company is not ready to replace the phone. There are saying that only repair is possible. Which is  I ma fine with. All I want in return that send me confirmation on mail that same issue will not arise in future but they are not even ready to take guarantee for their own product. (THIS IS WHAT THIS BRAND IS). I have put my hard earn money on this phone.  I have visited service center for 6 time and have called in customer number many times yet there is not solution. Please if any one can guide me how to escalate this issue. It would be very much helpful.Updates. I am following up the company since last 25 days yet there is no solution from their end.I am have done so many research on it. It is manufacturing defect Samsung service center executive has told me that. I have all the proof. I am planning to file complain in court now. They are selling sub standard products. This my last Samsung phone which anyways I am not going to use it.  I will raise compensation demand in cash. Those who wants to file case. We can file a case in group as well. As we are facing same dead display problem (Display Blackout ). There are not just spoiling their image. Amazon has to look into this matter  as well. Please those wants to file case can join contact me on my email id girishpatel2433@gmail.com

Substandard product from samsung
","
I purchased it on 24 sep and on 23rd October morning after charging, the screen went blank(BSOD) and I cant use the mobile. 23 and 24 are service center holidays and on 25 th service center after taking around 1 hr time and opening my mobile confirmed that display is gone and needs to be replaced. Displays are out of stock and asked for 4-5 days time. Having no other option and as return window is closed by 1st October, i agreed . Still in warranty, hopefully the display replacement is free of cost. I met other guy with same issue same model and same one month usage.Seems this is a sub standard product from samsung. This is my first phone from samsung and used mobiles starting from Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, One Plus..this is my first visit to any mobile service center in the last 20 years or so. Totally disappointed with samsung.Just hoping the replaced display will come longer.Huge discount on this model in sale , may be I should have not fallen. Bye bye samsung after this phone.Update:I got mobile back on 29th Oct and display was replaced free of cost as it was under warranty. But lost all my Data(which was informed) and had to setup again from scratch.Just hoping this will not happen again even after warranty.Pretty sure this is my last mobile from samsung. Bye bye.Update2:Iam seeing lot of reviews where in many mentioning its issue with Amazon purchased mobiles only, NO, I met 2 guys when Iam in service center and both had purchased from the same store where service center is located. So its issue with Samsung doesnt matter it is store purchase or Amazon.

Screen black out issue within 15 min of delivery.
","
I got the order on 27th evening. I opened the package inserted the sim and started the phone while selecting the wifi option the screen went black. Phone was having 58% charge it is vibrating or making sound if I try to charge it.Imediately contacted customer care they said technician will come and see what is the issue. and they will proceed for the exchange. If any one went through this please let me know what solution did you got from this ?Now waiting for the Technician. I will update how this process goes..Day 2.Appointmnet for technician was fixed after 2 days.slot was 10 am to 2 pm. got a text message from amazon that I will be there till 10.30am.but thechinical guy did not show up. tried calling CC they assured they will arange it till 2pm but it was not done they have booked other slot after 2 days again.Now waiting for the next day.  I will update what the day unfolds on that day.Amazon Policy : ( As described by amazon customer care )1. They can only replace or refund ( whatever option available ) when the techincal guy give there report  to the amazon.  And there have been many cases where technical guy have submited a wrong report to amazon at last  customer suffers in this case.2. Amazon dose not have any control over the techincal service.  They can't find out where the technical person is they can't contact them they even can't communicate  with them. I don't know how amazon approve this kind of Important service on which they dont have  any control.

Phone Screen went dead in 10 days after purchase!
","
Please do your research about the phone before you buy this phone.I bought this phone from Amazon during the Dussehra Sale Offer and I was quite happy with the Amazon fast delivery. But after 10 days of use, one morning the phone screen went blank n dead.  The phone was working as i could hear the incoming call ringtone and also the phone vibrate but mobile screen was blackout.So immediately I took the phone to the nearest Samsung service center and told them the issue. Initially they said don't worry sir since it's just 10 days from activation Samsung has complete product return n replacement policy. But then when I said it's bought from Amazon they said sorry sir in that case we just have only the warranty coverage and no complete replacement applicable! Also, when I was in the service center seeing my samsung s20 fe box fellow customers who also had similar problem called out to me asking ""oh! same issue ah!"". There were 2 customers with similar issue (phone screen blackout in few days from purchase) on that day.I feel something is not right about the Samsung s20 fe 5G as a complete product. Maybe some QA check's were comprised before the product market release. If it's just one-off instance of similar issue we can ignore and say like 1 in 100 issue can happen but that's not the case here. I asked the Samsung CC person how many such issues reported, she said with a smile, yeah quite a few similar customer issues reported!

Black screen of death
","
Bought this during one of the sales for a decent amount of discount. But within a month of buying this phone the screen stopped working. It just went blank while I was browsing. I thought the phone shut down and kept trying to turn it on. But it wasn't responding. So I started removing the sim to put in a different phone and the phone made a sound as soon as the tray popped out, that's when I realised the phone is on but the screen had shut off.After some googling I found that this is fairly common for Samsung phones. It's been happening for many years and Samsung hasn't bothered to fix it. If only I had known this before buying the phone...This had even happened to my father's phone some 5 or so years ago. But it started back up after the phone battery discharged completely a day later, and didn't have a problem after that so brushed it off as a one off issue and didn't really look into it too much. Wasn't as lucky with this phone, will be going to a Samsung service center soon, lets see how that goes.Wanted to buy Samsung foldables in the future, but hesitant of Samsung phones in general now. Especially since this is a fairly frequent issue and they haven't bothered to fix it after so many years. And foldables have their own screen issues as well.Until this issue cropped up I was fairly happy with this phone. I would have given it 4.5 stars. One point that did bother me a bit was the weight. This thing is heavier and bulkier in hand than the M52 that my father has, despite having a smaller battery. I guess it is the better cameras and a metal frame addibg some weight. Premium touches no doubt, but the M52 is a bit more comfortable to hold in the hand and it has a marginally bigger screen and battery.  Anyway not a big deal, it was a good phone overall.

The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Just in 2 days after delivery
","
The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Phone was delivered on 02/10/22 and stopped working on 04/10/22. Phone screen gose completely black out suddenly while using. And now not starting. I tried to replace this via Amazon app but the option is not available their the only option is to get the technician visit and the slot is not available for technicain visit. After calling the Amazon customer care i got appointment for 07/10/22.I am editing this review today on 14/10/22 now my phone is replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Amazon and their customer support team. Now my phone is working fine.But i have one doubt if i i have got the new phone or not. The box was sealed but when I opened their was some dirt stick on the phone. As the phone screen guard was their. Also the charging adaptor was not properly at its place.  It seem that in transit these was displaced. But generally this dose not happen. As the package is made in such a way to avoid these displacementI want to ask Samsung and Amazone if they are supplying phone with screen guard applyed on Galaxy S20FE 5G. And durt on the screen guard. Is it standerd from Samsung. I think definitely not. Request Amazone and Samsung to clearify this. I have a doubt the phone i got is refurbished. I request Samsung to clearify my doubt by checking the sl no. And IMIE no. In their records.

FE means Fool's Edition
","
Screen - So-called Samsung's AMOLED is hype. It took me a lot of time to adjust to this screen because the colors are inaccurate.I'm using vivid mode with the white balance slider turned all the way to the right, i.e. warm.120Hz is a gimmick on this phone. You are forced to use it because 60Hz is unrealistically laggy. Compared to the aged Pixel 2XL, this phone is in no way faster by any means.Moreover, the refresh rate is not adaptive, therefore, battery drain is horrible.Speakers - Average, lack natural bass. The overall sound is on the sharper side.Battery - Poor. Don't trust screen on time. You have to charge it twice a day. I don't know what kind of a person is ""mild"" in this day and age.Performance - Software is poorly optimized. Performance is not good. It doesn't feel like a flagship.No headphone jack, but that's okay, nobody likes music anymore.Expandable storage - This is the only pro, everything else is a con. They removed this one too in S21 FE.Camera - Why do people say colors are subjective? Who purposefully likes unnatural oversaturated greens of foliage, exaggerated reds, and blues which look like they are painted on with a double brush?The overall photo is childish and basic. Compared to the Google Pixel 2, this camera is crap.And the camera app lags like crazy. It takes irritatingly long to get into the camera app, for it to be ready for clicking a shot.Ultrawide cameras are all gimmicks, so much more especially in this phone.Telephoto lacks resolution.The video quality is decent.The fingerprint sensor is horrible. Painful, really painful. You will curse it.Software - Thankfully no ads but miles away from the stock experience. Even though it has 865 SD, it feels like a middle-range phone. No, the software is NOT snappy. There are no glaring lags either but just not what you would expect. Or perhaps my expectations from a Samsung phone are unreasonable. Updates ain't so fast either. Samsung treats FE models as an afterthought.Bottom line - Don't buy this phone even if it sells for a single rupee above 30K. I made a mistake. Look elsewhere, don't be fooled by a ""near-flagship"" experience because there is none.

Samsung Fan, Good Phone, SCREEN BLACKOUT,  Great Camera
","
I have brought this phone on august 2022 on sale for 28600, That was a great deal for this phone and I have never seen this phone in this price range. I feel heating issue at first 2 days of use  while charging, streaming Youtube and playing games(BGMI). But after software update it seems fine and doesn't have that much heating issue any more. overall the phone looks good, camera is great and a descent battery life (1 day life with streaming + browsing + call ), finger print scanner is ok not that best in market. Battery wont be enough if you are a gamer.The real issue came after 3 months of use, one day the SCREEN got BLACKED OUT while using message app. I m a Samsung fan and I have been using Samsung phone's for around 15 year. This is the first time I m facing such an issue( only freezing issue found in previous phones ), it can be restarted but screen will be blacked out after a while. and it got fixed by SCREEN REPLACEMENT from service center. And the ISSUE is there for more users who PURCHASED on SALE DAY, some people already logged this in Samsung community. Only because of this I'm giving this phone a 2 star review.

Very disappointed product from Samsung
","
Very very disappointed, I never expected this kind of product from Samsung.Within 20 days (accurately after 17days of usage), the phone suddenly showed a black screen even though vibration and other things were working in the background. The black screen was not resolved even after trying hard booting many times. Since it was more than 14 days Service center team member told me that it can't be replaced but can be repaired.After an initial investigation, it was communicated that it is a defective piece. The screen and battery needed to be replaced. The estimated service time was 1 day.The next day when I enquired, they told me that the parts are not yet arrived and it will take 2 more days, Hoping that there will be no further delay.I never faced this kind of problem with Xiaomi phones before, I think I made the wrong decision to switch to Samsung phones. It has caused so much trouble as I am not able to authenticate my authentication on some of the cloud portals due to this issue.The only good point which made to buy this phone was the camera quality,  But what is the use of having a good camera when the phone itself is very unstable and has a black screen issue?

Shocking poor build quality
","
Bought in Jun 2022, delivered on 25th Jun, I find this hardware button to be broken/disassociated on Nov 5, 2022. Lucky for me, the part got lodged in my pocket and I could put a cello-tape and sort of fix it (jugaad). However, this has convinced me to not go with Samsung products anymore. The quality is deteriorating. BTW, the phone never fell from my hand, had a protector almost immediately. Now of course, Samsung will claim I (or my kids, or somebody else) MUST have dropped it. I have spent too much of time setting this up, and I can't give it to anybody without a huge inconvenience.Photo taken on iPhone bought in Feb 2021, (for context), fell twice till now, also has protectors, going strong.

Not a good deal

It's been one month since I got trapped.1. Battery life is average. It takes a lot of time to get fully charged. If u use the phone while charging, it will take more than 5hrs for fully charged2. Back camera is very nice, but selfie camera is waste. U can't make quality reels and u will look like chudel in video calling. No flash for selfie camera in this price range.3. Touch is just ok.4. Phone is a bit heavy.5. Not worth for 30k at all. Think twice before you buy this 🤔.Note - I listed it on OLX already

The price at which you are getting this phone...... you cab go with one plus either....one plus has good battery backup with fast charging support... even after spending 30k on Samsung we are not getting fast charging support...it only offers 25w that too you have to buy adapter separately.The seller has taken away too much time to deliver as well... no issue with product recevied the product in best condition.

Mobile suddenly and silently stopped display. Don't recommend this model.

I brought this mobile few days before Dusara festival as I had my old MI mobile and wanted a new one. Thought to buy Samsung as it is very popular one and went for this Samsung Galaxy 20 FE. Used it for 2-3 weeks very carefully as it was new mobile and wanted to keep it safe till Diwali at least :). I had my personal data and office apps on it. 2 days back i kept it near me and was doing office work. had to call my colleague for urgent work in the weekend and this mobile stopped display and had to suffer a lot as i had my office app, contact numbers etc and even UPI apps on it.now i am unable to return it from AMAZON website. Need to call Samsung customer care...don't know how is the support from Samsung. I would suggest not to go for this model.

The phone is great in many aspects; I purchased it even after reading about its average battery life, but I’m highly disappointed after 1 week of usage even after starting with low expectations.I charged my iPhone 12 and Samsung S20fe to 100% last night and left them on my desk when I slept; this morning when I woke up, the iPhone is still at 100% whereas Samsung is at 92% (after 8 hrs of no usage)On normal days (with screen on time of 2-3 hrs) the battery doesn’t even last till the evening, and this is despite 60hz refresh rate and turning off several battery consuming features like NFC, nearby device scanning, location, Auto app updates, several personalisation features. I checked in the setting and it says 3% was used by google play services, 1% WhatsApp and % Samsung store. I’ve set all of these apps on the most minimalist modes, and yet have this battery drain.Regret buying this phone. Feels like Samsung and Amazon sold me lemon by discounting it heavily

Camera is best, display is great but in Samsung OS most of the apps are not working due to modified OS. Second point is, it is really over priced. I don't know why this phone is too costly as there is nothing new in this phone as compared to all other Samsung phones in the price 10K to 30K

Wondering if it's a flagship!
","
This doesn't come with 25w charger and headsets out of box for such premium price.You have to buy it manually.Usb C to 3.5 jack adapter from samsung only works, if you like to use existing headset, so that's an additional purchase.If you're buying in 2022, you may get android update in Mar 2023 and security update till 2024.Observing heating issue while charging with regular 15w charger.Hope this helps!

Not really a flagship
","
In call sound is so loud. It's irritating. Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use headphones/headsets/earbuds,etc.  everytime while speaking. Or if you can use loudspeaker..And remember they have aped Apple hence no 3.5mm jack slot. Either Bluetooth or wired headset with type c cable.

Reviewing after 2 months of usage as my Primary device..
","
This is totally my personal opinion about the phone, there are too many aspects to talk about and it will definitely help you with your buying...1. Look and build: (8 out of 10)  Firstly it is a good-looking phone for me, simple and sober, with a metallic frame the phone feels good on the hands too, back made of plastic and not too prone to scratches, even I dropped it a couple of times but it is fine as of now. So the plastic build is a key for those who don't use covers. but you must regret not having a 3.5mm jack.2. DIsplay: (7 out of 10) To be honest display is good but not as good as other Samsung flagship, I was using it along with the Samsung S9 and Realme X2pro side by side on 1080p resolution but the s9 and X2pro look more sharp and bright as compared, Pixel density and brightness nits are satisfactory but not issue in outdoors. overall the display looks good.3. Performace:(7 out of 10) It is the key part for me, with regular day-to-day tasks, multitasking app switching everything is fine unless it comes to gaming. the device comes with SD865 and on paper, it is a very good  SOC for performance and for gaming also, but Samsung doing it very wrong in the part of gaming, I m daily driver Bgmi player and I play it a lot, in the term of gaming performance it works really poor as compared to my Realme X2pro with SD 855plus. with the smooth extreme setting, there are high Visible frame drops and stutters. frames drop as low as 40-35 fps as compared to X2pro which continues to maintain 55-60 fps. Samsung does not work well on gaming optimization. So as my view who looks for a good gaming phone go for Realme Oneplus or other but if gaming is not that matter then definitely go for this.4. Camera:(9 out of 10) It is another key point for me, the camera performance on this phone looks excellent, I am fond of photography and for me, the camera works really well on color balance dynamic range, etc. wide-angle camera and portrait mode is excellent and the sensor works really good on low light conditions. the primary sensor OIS works really well but Video mode with the wide-angle lens is missing. Samsung must add it with updates. Overall the camera is really good.5. Battery: (8 out of 10)4500 mah is kind of enough for a mid-user. it typically lasts for a day most of the time. Battery management and optimization are good. But for the heavy users with heavy app load and background load the phone needs to charge more than one time a day.6. multimedia:(9 out of 10) Videos and movie watching experience is fun on this as the volume is loud and the Dolby sound and stereo effect works really well.7.UI:(8 out of 10) Samsung One UI looks clean and good but comes with lots of preinstalled bloatware ( some of them are uninstallable ) and adds( can be disabled while device setup or from the settings) and Android 11 and Samsung Nox security is a key part of this phone as the device comes with hardware base extra layer of security. and Samsung is good at pushing regular security updates and 3 years platform update. and it makes the device future-proof.8. Network reception:(9 out of 10) I am using airtel as primary sim. there is not carrier aggregation in my area. but devices support it also it supports Vowifi and dual-band WIFI so no issue with the network reception.I brought it for 41k with an extra 7k discount. and it kind of value of money for me because of the Brand name. and it is a really good phone from Samsung. but in this price segment, and there are lots of other options to look for.

Bought this for Rs 26500 and worth every penny
","
Even though this phone was launched 2 years back but 865 processor is still worth Rs 26500. The Camera is just amazing! other mid-rangers like M52 , A52s etc. are not even close.The battery is decent but since my usage includes normal day-to-day functions - WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome,5-10 photo clicks and some paytm types app and I set the refresh rate to 60Hz, I am able to use it for 2 days easily on single charge. The phone comes by default with screen guard which is not tempered glass but does provide some protection. The back cover is glasstic and needs some protection, Either the phone cover is such that or best is to get a film protection for its back as well just like screen.Overall Battery is 8.5/10(For normal usage where 60Hz refresh rate is also fine)Camera is 10/10, front Camera  =  9/10Performance for normal user = 10/10(Not sure about gamers)In-Hand Feel is perfect= 9/10Screen Quality  = 10/10

Very Smooth phone

DisPlay- 5 star.Processor- 5 Star-5G Ready powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Octa-Core processor.Battery- 3.5 Star-Speaker- 5 star.Fingerprint-3.5 star.Camera-5 star.Design- 5 star.Build quality- 5 star.Display:The display has a Super Amoled Panel. It has a fast refresh rate of 120hz. The colors are saturated as usual in a Super Amoled panel. The display is very bright as well. It is very smooth.UI:Packed of features. There is no doubt that Samsung is one of the best UI out there for Android.Battery:The phone has 4500mah. Easily lasts a day. Could last even longer if used in 60hz. The phone supports upto 25w charging. It also supports reverse charging. It even supports reverse wireless charging!!Performance: A top of the line processor by Samsung. Would've been better if the indian version had gotten the Snapdragon 865 chipset. But the 5g Version does have SD 865 but it is much more costlier.Camera:The camera sure is 12MP but it takes much more details than expected by a 12MP camera. It is a very capable capable unit under bright environments. But you can see lots of noise in dark environments.Finaly.Cons:1. Battery drains fast.2. It supports 25W charging but comes with 15W charger.3. Little Heating problem.Pros:1. Fully water proof.(IP68 Rated).2. Powerful Processor.3. Camera is super good.

Superb camera, speed, resolution

Amazon screwed up delivery for the first time. I cancelled and ordered again after a week availing exchange offer. Plus, got discount on using a certain credi card. For 25k, this is a fantastic phone. The camera is outstanding. I have a DSLR and can confidently say that this pictures from this phone are as good as that, quality wise. Thanks to 8GB RAM, the phone functions smoothly. The screen resolution is top notch. I read a lot of complaints on screen conking off after few days. It's been 10 days since I have been using the phone. Thankfully, no issues for me yet. Hoping for the best 😄 The phone charges very quickly and battery life is very good for a moderate user like me who doesn't watch too many videos or okays games. Overall a fantastic phone at this price range. Go for it 👍👍

S20 FE 5g is very good product. I like the look and feel . Its real nice. Network connectivity is excellent. I get good 4G plus network.  5g is still not launched in my city. So can't talk about 5g. Bettery optimisation is very good. And nothing to say more about the software experience.  Its Samsung One UI. Just Great , no lag , no bug . I find it like this. So finally it a very good product by Samsung.

Best Midrange mobile at 30k
","
Bought this for 30k (In prime sale + Bank offers and No COST EMI).Screen: Absolutely stunning, it supports 60Hz and 120Hz. It doesn't switch automatically between these settings, you need to select it from settings.Rear Camera: Really nice, seriously good. Not just good enough.Front camera - A bit disappointed, it's good but not as good as rear camera.Performance - You can play games like Call of duty or BGMI at Max graphics settings that the game supports. It heats up a bit after playing for a hour. Which is absolutely normal considering it has Snapdragon 865 and as saying goes with great processors comes a little bit of heatings. Just know that it's normal, don't expect any mobile to not heatup while charging or doing heavy works. That's universal.Finger Print reader - Good, no complains. Won't feel any significant delay or issues.Charger - It comes with 15W USB type C charger and it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to fully charge the battery. Mobile however supports upto 25W charger and it also supports wireless charging which I haven't tested. Don't buy a separate 25W charger for this, because the 25W charger takes only 10 minutes less than 15W charger to fully charge it.Sim cards - Supports 2 5G sim cards and upto 1TB (confirm this) expandable storage. However the slot is hybrid, it means you can't use both sim cards and external memory card at once. Either use both sim cards or 1 Sim card and external memory card.I don't think you will need external memory card because it has 128GB internal storage which is enough for normal users.It comes with Android 12 and Samsung one UI 4.1 and will support updates upto Android 13.It doesn't have headphone jack.Box contains - Mobile, Charger and Charger cable. Sim ejector.Amazon usually have discount (without prime sale), so don't buy without any discounts.As of August 2022, Expect it around 30k to 33k. Don't buy above this price because it randomly comes down to this price on some days.Personal suggestion: buy a cover ASAP. I droped it next morning and fortunately nothing broke, got a scratch around camera bump. Camera bump is made of glass-ish stuff and it can break very easily. So just keep that in mind.

Bloat, bloat and even more bloat
","
Revised from three to one star - phone not able to make outgoing calls, or send outgoing messages. Totally defective with no way to get a replacement. Require another piece of junk software to be installed to 'diagnose' phone issues and obv it will give a clear result. Or some 'technician' visit.Samsung as usual, does not know how to do things. Totally useless piece of E-waste. Stay away.Gap between order and delivery was about 6 hours, give or take. That is exceptional and a shout to all those hard-working boys and girls at Samsung and Amazon. I needed the phone urgently as my venerable mum's even more venerable G7+ was on its last legs. I was told that Samsung make decent phones (she does live in a signal hole), but have a bit of an issue with bloat (more on that later). We didn't really take issue with the sidegrade, she's a very basic user and the 778 would hit the sweet spot.For your money you get a decent processor and what seems on the face of it a good screen, given the spec. There's more than enough storage, and the only real drawback (or so I thought at the time) was the plastic body. It was a bit more than that.The biggest issue I faced was the amount of bloatware and the considerably complicated setup because of this. Samsung has its own permissions for its apps, and a lot of them can't be removed or modified at all. The hard-baking of bloatware into the Android subsystem leaves a very bad taste, as if the manufacturer is petrified of people removing their apps.There is not even a shred of an attempt to make the UI clean, it looks like a cartoon novel after first setup. If they want to learn from Apple (who I'm not that fond of either - but they do have their upsides), they need to figure out how to make a clean-looking interface and to make it simpler to setup.I actually had to hard-reset the phone at one point - because some dependency didn't properly complete; let all the Samsung nonsense install and then remove as much (and shut off as many permissions) as I could. Still ended up with a Franken-UI, so that's the price you pay for getting these devices. I guess they can claim ""xx million people using our apps"" for more marketing push, like ponzi funds.The second issue is the screen. Apart from being the only heat radiating surface on this plastic device, it is almost perfectly useless when it comes to  colour. The white balance adjustment range is too narrow, and the natural preset is not natural at all. So you're stuck with 'Vivid' (which is Samsung's way of making everything brown and orange) and a colour balance slider.The problem is magnified at indoor-level brightness settings, where no amount of fiddling will net the corrct balance between white balance and intensity. While it is an OLED screen, the tuning is horribly subpar. I've known Samsung's issue with colour on TVs, and this seems to keep the tradition alive. I am comparing with the Asus ROG 5 which is also OLED, and it is tuned a million times better than this. I don't expect the cameras to fare any better and going by the reviews, they don't. Thankfully we have no use for the cameras except for the most basic tasks.This is the last Samsung I'm buying, ever. They just don't seem to get it right.On the positive side, the M52 is very slim and the presence of actual bezels makes side touches a thing of the past (helpful for the elderly). It's also very light, and the screen coating is very good. Ringer is nice and loud, useful in noisy environments. Since the SIM migration hasn't been completed I can't comment on the signal reception, but I will update that later. I try to stay as far way as possible from Chinese brands (because of very poor UI design) but might reverse that in the next round.

But guess what I can't coz they gave me FAKE IMEI NO. This fake no is not registered and I can't even exchange it. This has taught me one lesson very clearly plz guys DONT BUY MOBILES FROM AMAZON.

Not worth it even at deep discount
","
The first phone that arrived had dead pixels (vertical pink-green lines, see last pic attached) don't know how samsung is shipping these defected junk phones from Vietnam without even inspecting. Thanks to amazon it was replaced.Now lets talk about pros first because there are very few. Frankly, there is just one. The Amoled 120Hz screen is really good. Punchy colours, smooth coz of high refresh and bright. Best screen in this price (after discount). And that's probably the only good thing about this phone. Let's talk about why you should avoid this phone like a plague:1. Impressed with SD778G at discounted price? Truth is Samsung's horrible throttling governors and pisspoor heat dissipation makes this chip perform like SD 720G at max. Forget gaming, slightly longer workloads are an uphill task on this phone. Never seen a phone perform this poorly with such a fast chip. Samsung excels in making the slowest performing phone with highest possible specs on sheet.2. 5000 mah battery sounds good? Actually it's only 4800 something. Samsung lies on it's spec sheet. My last phone had 3750mah and typical 4000Mah but they were honest and advertised only former, real capacity. What's shocking is, after 4 years that phone (12nm chipset) still lasts longer on a charge than this ""5000"" Mah phone (6nm chipset) and I will get to the reason later. One day is absolute max you will get. Sometimes you will need to charge twice a day. And this phone has inferior Lithium-ion chemistry when phones are moving to Lithium-poly (more charge cycles).3. Missing/poor hardware. Newer samsung phones lack charger completely and even this one only has a slow 15W charger not 25W which phone supports. These stingy people give you the shortest cable humanely possible. Hope you have a charging point right besides your ears.  Hadd hai chindigiri ki bhi. Check Ampere screenshot which I attached it's charging at 5W. No headphone jack, no dedicated SD card slot, no stereo speakers. All just horrible choices from Samsung. Camera is plain average. Chinese (atleast made in India, unlike this Vietnam make) phones are making better cameras now.4. And lastly the most terrible thing on this phone is the software. I was willing to ignore everything else but the software is downright torture. It's not the One UI, that's fine, it's the junkware, crapware, spyware and bloatware they bundle on M series phones. If you uninstall them, Galaxy store installs them again. At every restart it asks that please enable all the crapware. They keep running in background sending all your data to their servers, killing batterylife. RAM is always bloated. They spam notifications and Samsung has made it, so you can't disable those notifications. Out of 128 GB you only get 98 GB free, imagine the amount of Crap they pre-installed.I am so disgusted by this whole experience I have simply blacklisted this brand for all future purchases regardless of product. My simple advice is STAY AWAY FROM THIS TERRIBLE BRAND. I also request amazon to remove trusted brand label (phone replacements are very high, too many defected screen reviews here).

Samsung Not Reliable after a Year
","
Samsung generally disappoints after a year. My family has used 4 models for some time now. Starting with the charger of the recent ones to charging port of the mobile, Slowness, apps going off  from groups, mobile and app crashes. It’s really frustrating to use after a year or so. I personally use apple for more than 10 yrs now and it’s worth the premium except for the XR.

The phone specs are impressive for the price but basic functionality of phone is unstable after upgrade to Android 12.  Hence the whole unit is useless.  I found following serious problem.  Display and screen freeze frequently, sudden reboot, screen going blank and phone behaviour unpredictable for all the above occurrences.  Product need to be tested for basic functionality before final release else SAMSUNG will dent its name for quality going forward. Samsung need to have quality control like Sony or Toyota if they need to survive and not the way it currently releases the product without basic testing not done and product failure at basic level itself.

Phone hangs alot and i dont know only I m facing issue or what bt at the time of receiving of call when the phone turned out from pocket not able to receive call screen hangs, u have too put the screen off and On only after that U able to receive call....Noticed frame drops after 15-20 min of gaming this phn is not for gamers even after antutu benchmarks are above 5 lacs.Side mounted fingerprint is hit & miss many of times, don't understand why in display finger print not given .....Only thing I liked about the phone is Super amoled display it performs great , U will love to enjoy ur favourite content on it.. camera is also gud in day light but struggle alot in artificial condition.......U will like the screen & enjoy content in full HD but not on Netflix....120Hz is a lit.... loved it alot ....Battery back up is also decentSpeaker is a bit low bt manageable....No type C to 3.5mm jack available even not available in market this is useless policy,& the big thing it supports 25 watt charging bt in box only 15 watt adapter & heats up alot even in 15 watt charging.....Final verdict :- If u are a light to moderate user and use phone for content watching and moderate gaming then u will go for this device with some compromises but if u r a heavy user like me then pls guys don't waste UR hard earned money on it rather than invest ur money on a better device......

 Excellent battery life. Excellent fingerprint scanner. While watching content we can observe cloudy patches in dark scenes. I have posted a video at full brightness. Not at all great. If for content viewing, then this is not the option for you. I had to learn it the hard way. Other than that, for normal day to day use, the phone is good. Speakers are not at all good. Plz keep that in mind as it comes only with one down firing speaker which is not great at all.My verdict would be: Skip this one please.

A few things

1. Charging feels slow. 25W charger should have been included in the box. Also, please consider increasing the charging speed.2. There should be an option to disable Samsung's pre-installed bloatware apps.3. There is no way to disable notifications for some pre-installed apps.Otherwise the phone works good and screen is quite decent.

This will be helpful for you...Ordered 8gb variant on 24th in prime day sale at 21k price and received on 30th July. It took little  bit extra time to deliver product but you can expect that as this mobile was in hype(still). And it went out of stock too.First impressions:_1. In hand feel is OK. It could have been premium feel if they have at least provided aluminum sides. Bt at the same time samsung able to manage weight distribution perfectly. Mobile is so sleek and light weight  it can fall off from your hand mistakenly. Need both hands to use full screen functions though they have provided one hand gesture control.2. First thing you are going to notice when you will get this Mobile in you hand is the Display. It's just outstanding. It feels like buttery smooth. 🧈3. Battery is awesome. I charged it yesterday. From yesterday to till now its not drained faster though I'm using all the productivity apps except gaming.(will try soon and update you)4. Haptic feedback is above average.5. I like side mounted fs over in-display fingerprint scanner. It's actually way too fast. Trust me!6. Almost took 1hr50min to charge 97%. {15w}7. I didn't found any issue with Display while opening camera in full ratio. Also didn't found any green tint on Display near camera. 😕8. Yes, you will need to apply skin or need back cover for this Mobile.9. Though it has a mono Speaker still it is throwing  ample amount of threshold  sounds. And i checked it. It's above avg.10. Sensors are way too accurate (gyro,light etc.)11. You can hear cheap click sound when you press on/off button. (OK fr me in this discount  offer 😀)Will update review after few days.

Overall Quality

The Phone is quite Good for Daily life usage Also Display quality is awesome I've been using from last 2 weeks there's No issues regarding daily Usage, and performance but while Doing heavy gaming I see bit heat but no Surprise because this phone has 778G not very Good for very Heavy Gaming but yes Intermediate Gamers can use this. Camera quality is not so Satisfied, I think they didn't optimised the Camera Quality to it's best, so I recommend If u Checking for Camera phone Then don't go for this phone, and About Battery I see there's Slight Drainage of battery in daily usage, but it's not noticeable let's See after 6 months use, so overall This Phone is Quite Good Buying under 22K, u can Go for this phone.

Great all-rounder at 20k
","
The overall experience is pretty good. Camera is best as I purchased it at 20k without 8gb variant without bank offer. Performance is also very good. Handles Asphalt 9, COD Mobile at high graphics without any issue. And after update oneui 4.1 is pretty stable than expected. I faced no issue in network connectivity till now.But I expected a bit better battery life at 5000mAh. But it's very much okay for a full day usage. Would have been better if Samsung provided a 25watt adaptor with the box or included some offer for buying the adopter at a decent price. Takes around 1 hours 20 mins to get 20%-100%, and that's okay for me. The best part of this phone is undoubtedly the Display. It's amazing! I mean if you consume content on this phone, I'll be loving it.The fingerprint sensor is superfast but it's being an issue for me initially as I was pretty accustomed with in display fingerprint sensor in my previous phone.Overall if you're not a hardcore gamer, like stream your games online and want a good phone that you can use without any tension of UI, Battery, Camera, Performance and ok with a Polycarbonate build, it's a super phone from Samsung at 20-23k.

A Typical Samsung Phone with a good processor chipset.
","
Samsung Galaxy m52 5g comes with Snapdragon 778g processor which is quite well optimized. The only con in this phone is the charger given in the box itself. It is of 15W which takes upto 2hrs to charge full. It comes with OneUI 3.0 with Android 11.Overall the gaming was decent in this phone. But u know Samsung phones are not gaming centric.Multitasking was the main feature of samsung phones. The handy UI of samsung which I love the most attracted me towards this phone.You will get update for OneUI 4.0 and Android 12. And also for upcoming Android 13 with OneUI 5.0.So if you u looking for a typical Samsung phone with long lasting battery(5000mAH) and a good processor then this is it in the phone price segment, it's one of its kind.And yeah its very slim and light weight. You will take 3 4 days to get use to with this phone.

Performance, display, batterybackup are very well  on this phone.Camera colour  correction  is not  good but the clarity and the details given is good. But that's  not the  main  problem. The problem  is the body buildquality. It's  ok to be a plastic  back. But it takes so much  scratches even  i put a case on it. Otherwise  it's the most beautiful designd and well  Performance  midrange smartphone  in my opinion.

Received defective phone and running from one customer care to another to replace the phone
","
Below is the experience so far.1. Received a defective product. Battery was getting drained out in few hours, wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble,  including Google maps. (Location was not getting captured)2. Tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app I open. (tried on 7th night as well, but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile - Amazon app was in this phone. Used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile)3. Amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6. First visit to center, they did a software update (3 week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending) and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. Faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. Second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn't allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they don't have the authority for that.10. Called customer care number again, and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the seller.So back to step 3. Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , If I manage to reach there.Update :11. All customer care said they can't replace the phone. So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. Again, whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again.12. I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist (battery was draining out by the minute). I showed it to them. They told me it's a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. They also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. Used for 2 days. Same situation. No improvement.13. Went back to them again. They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience.17. I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. They refused with all their might and said ""phone is working now"". During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. I officially registered a complaint. But still no luck of returning the phone.Update on Nov 30th.18. I was traveling and outside the country. On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70% charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980's. Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times. No luck. Still grid lines. My flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip.19. Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. (Nov 30th.) Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. They mentioned ""patch issue. Software update dint happen"" . At this point, I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. No 3 month old phone's screen will stop responding because of software update missing. They are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.

Worst phone money can buy.

It was an awful GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL'22 for me. I bundle ordered this phone along with a pathetic mattress from Wakefit. The mattress got cancelled 3 days after scheduled delivery, and this phone does not even work.4 hours into using it, I was on a phone call and suddenly it makes a lot of noise that goes away on speaker mode only to return upon turning the speaker OFF. While still continuing with the speaker mode, the call was dropped. After repeated attempts to place the call I realized SIM 1 is not recognized. I turned off and reinserted a different SIM, and it still read NO SIM 1. There is this obnoxious heating part which I discounted in the initial few hours, but it only got worse in that limited time this phone worked.Soon it started going insane, restarting every few seconds and I was tired after a long day at work. I just dropped it on my study table to go to sleep and whole night it gave a DJ lighting effect while turning ON and OFF all on its own!This is not even the worst, I contacted Amazon; a TECHNICAL EXPERT says she couldn't initiate a return/refund on this product. She rechecked only to say not possible. She can only exchange the phone that too after a diagnosis by their expert who will visit me 3 days later! Like I said in the first paragraph, I reminded her off my mattress that was cancelled from their end. She feels so SORRY about it, but wont accept return. That's rich! They are okay with seller cancelling the delivery without informing the customer, that too after making the customer wait for 11 days. But they won't accept a return on an insane piece of crap that they call M53.I asked her to transfer the call to the team that will answer about my mattress and she did. This guy seems sensible and accepted the return in few minutes of explaining the issue. He promptly arranged for the return pick-up next day. This was the Amazon India I have known for years, but now! I returned the phone after a lot of effort and currently waiting for the refund as I type this.To try a non-Chinese midrange phone I have gone for this, but now I wouldn't dare to buy a Samsung phone again.

Samsung is a joke!! Never purchase a samsung phone again

 I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the recently purchased product which is the Samsung M53 5G. I am really disappointed with the phone and the service centre. I have faced plenty of problems.Let me explain problems in the detail. I purchased a cell phone on 16th May 2022. It worked well for a couple of days. As I continued to use it, I found faults in the handset. Firstly, it played random noise at random times at any point in time. Thus, to fix it I went to the service centre. I explained everything to the service centre. They said that the latest software update would fix the problem so they took their time and updated the software. After a couple of days, new issue raised. i.e., the screen of the phone blacked out automatically. Nothing seemed to work when the screen was off. This was really frustrating.I don’t understand how the new phone within 15 days of purchase can work like a faulty piece? I chose this phone over Apple and OnePlus after considering all the factors and it seems to be the wrong choice for me after all. The surprising thing is when I asked the centre to replace the phone as it was creating a lot of problems and I can’t every time leave my office to fix the issues they denied and said we could do it if it is within 14 days from the date of purchase. However, it was 15 days so they did not do it. I really think this is a ridiculous way of taking care of customers.My phone is in WARRANTY (ONLY BEEN 15 DAYS)!Never purchase samsung phone!! Terrible experienceA REALLY FRUSTRATED CUSTOMER!!

Avoid Samsung

Samsung low range, mid range(upto 50k) mobile phone just sell only for brand & our mind is set for non Chinese brand, other wise Samsung make most third class phone in this price brand,A. No very good build quality (cheap type plstic & paint) B. Always use low quality processor (exenyos or or low end midiatek)C. Always use Samsung sensor for camera in this range, i have 20mp old dual camera HONOR phone, much much better than 108mp(only for show)D. Its amoled skin is only good part but that time he use below 400ppi & lower brightness (not proper show in sunlight)E. In few months lag also comingD. Only 25w charging speed,Now new technic no charger in tbe box,No screen guard applied, no back cover, no 3.5mm converter jack in the box. (local converter not work properly, only original Samsung converter will work, which price almost 800rs..now not available in Samsung store)This brand only running for our government support.. Nothing else..In this price range or below u get much much good quality phone in the market..My old phone was almost 4 years but camera is much better than & performance, display also very good.Samsung midrange just waist of the money..

Samasung's high priority Bug
","
This phone has lots of cons that still need to be upgraded. The price range should be 16000 to 20000 only.Battery is average ( was draining fast even when not in use ), Fingerprint is slow, Display is somehow good.The most bug that I detected from samsung is that there's a call sound problem ( both on loud as well as ear ) from the day of purchase.When I was calling someone else, call sound was high, I tried to down call volume on both Loudspeaker and ear speaker, but that remained same i.e. high. The call sound is not getting down, I restarted phone but still same issue. Second issue was with mic, The other person on call could not hear my voice ( with focus mode On/Off ) properly. Every time my voice was so less to the receiver, so had to talk loudly.Both these two issues were resolved automatically after 2 days ( don't know how ) for a short time. Then again faced.Thought that it maybe occurred with some phone's setting, therefore I called customer care from samsung. He said that you've to call Amazon customer care ( the product you purchased from ).So I called to amazon customer care and told the issue, they checked and offered me to return the phone.I returned this product.Also I had purchased Samsung Galaxy M32 5G about 9 months ago. After 7 days of software update in current month the same above mentioned problem I'm facing. However this problem was resolved temporarily when I rebooted but after 1 day again the same issue.This is so high glitch on samsung that disappointed me.I gave one star rating.

Gone for a Samsung phone after using MI n Oppo for last 7yrs and the experience is worst.My previous Oppo k1 is still much better than this phone which I thought I am upgrading.- Battery backup is not that good- Phone performance is not upto the mark, response time is lagging, doesn't feel like 6gb ram- Camera quality definitely doesn't justify the price- Automatic brightness is fully responsive- Contacts getting deleted automatically- Call settings got changed automatically twice.Only one good thing that justify the price and brand name is the display but if u need an overall good phone. Pls go for MI, Oppo, Vivo.No customer service after so many complains and tweets ..no one is bothering to call alsoWorst Exp - This is my last gadget of Samsung

 I was planning not to go for samsung M53 initially but previously I was using galaxy f41 which was quite fine especially the battery life. Thought I can now trust samsung blindly after that. Not knowing I will be sorry for that. First of all they removed the adapter from the box and selling it separately before that they used to troll Apple for removing adapter from the box. But the real problem was when I bought the original samsung adapter for the same it was working fine for 10-12 days but after that it was not charging M53 but charging other phones, I thought my phone has some issue but to my surprise when I plug into other charger it was charging the real irony was it was not charging the phone for which it was bought for. Not only this this phone has serious battery drain issue, i always put on battery saver yet it hardly last for a day. Hanging is also there and when the battery completely drains you have to put it for 4-5 hours of charging. I don't care about the camera.

Mobile data, Bluetooth and WiFi not working at all

The product was delivered on 21st Novemeber'22. From the 23rd, mobile data, WiFi and Bluetooth stopped working completely. When I searched for the solution online, several others reported the same issues with no solution. Store-based sellers are not offering the model and its service for the same problems. We made the mistake of relying solely on amazon reviews, where these problems were not mentioned. Please refrain from buying this model.

Online only models are trash...Please do not but that

This phone is like Arrange marriage. you will get this phone online only that means you can not see it before you buy.The phone is a collection of extremely cheap parts. Samsung does not give the charger and that is OK as they told it upfront. But the cable sent with the phone is so bad that below the metro station a 60 rupees cable is better than what is hipped by Amazon.neither  front and rear the camera are upto the mark. The performance is also too slow. Do not misguide yourself by fancy specifications.The speaker are also very  normal and similar to the phone 8000 which you can not hear even when you are alone in room...I can challenge if the voice is clear and loud than my iphone5.All you can do after buying this Samsung phone is write a review on Amazon which neither Samsung not Amazon will bother. So my recommendation is do not play blind with these Online only models and better  buy what you see. Once you see what you like buy it from anywhereyou can google ""Samsung phone restart problem"". You can find yourself how people are victim of Samsung online only

My Samsung Ph  have a poor audio quality from the time I purchased. couldn't return within the time as my mother was sick and  only son to take care of her. I reached out to Samsung store in Agra, they want me to leave the phone for 2-3 days and I don't have any spare phone. My request is can I return the ph and get the refund.

Very poor based on expectations
","
I used this device only for last 3 Days and based on it my feedback is1. WIFI - Very unstable and frequently  getting  disconnected  even my other device is connected  with same wifi.2. If I disabled  my WiFi and  trying to enable it again, It doesn't  enable  again and I need to reboot  my device3. SIM slot is not good, my micro SIM which get fit perfectly  does not fit in Samsung  M53 5G SIM slot and I have to push it to fit.4. Device  operation  based on 8Gb RAM is not upto mark when compared  with 8GB OPPO similar configuration device.Overall very average for me Samsung Galaxy M53 5G experience.

Battery sucks

M52 4g is better than this. As I have to charge it two times. Only camera quality is good. About 5g it is not launched in Pune's all areas. And 4g is enough to do your all activities. Don't buy it only for the sake of 5g. If you check 5g speed in spedtest it will consume 1gb of data only to check speed. So it's better to use 4g if you want to save data. I am mising my M52 for battery.

Hello everyone ,anyone who is planning to buy this phone please don't, the 108mp camera quality is very poor ,the performance is not upto mark ,oot platforms like hotstar doesn't work on it ,it got stuck many times while using ....please don't waste your money.....go for other brands in the same range oneplus or realme....

The phone is incompatible with BSNL sim. Samsung and Amazon should display this in the product profile. Sometimes, BSNL is the only service provider in your area and you cannot change it to any other service provider. Unaware people purchasing this phone feels cheated.

After long time I have decided to move from non-Chinese Mobile and I purchased Samsung M53. after buying this product I realized that this product is not having the basic functionality which I have been using since 2017. Can’t disconnect call by power button. Vibration when call connected and disconnected. Internet speed throughput Screenshot by Three finger moving on screen. Touch is not good. Some time multiple time has do move finger to receive call.Etc.

okay but not happy
","
phone okay, but not happy with (1) no audio jack port (2) no USB cable.The description says data cable, but both ends of the cable is C-type. This is good only for a phone to phone to connect. Not sure why phone to phone connection is mandatory as part of a phone purchase but a charging cable is not provided. One way, companies advocate to use an original adaptor and charging cable, but they instead provide only phone-to-phone connecting data transfer cable, which lets the users buy generic adaptors/charging cables. Samsung would have given a USB cable instead of a data transfer cable.And also, no Audio jack. The only option now is to go for a Bluetooth headset. I'm not a fan of Bluetooth headsets, but no option left now.

Here auto data mobile data from one sim to other is not found working in my phone, sim one data overe other have to manually change. Battry back is disappointing, in my new mobile purchase 100% charge mobile worked 1/2day only. Due to C to C cable we can't connect it with laptop or computer.

Don't buy Samsung Products.  They are not providing Charging Adapter.  There adapters are costly starting from 1300. (Oppo, Vivo Original Adapters starts from Rs.500). Adapters Quality is very bad.

Major disappointment
","
The focus for this flagship phone has tilted the scale too far on features like screen quality and camera to the point the basic hygiene factors have been ignored. Battery life for this phone is abysmally low and unreliable. It went from 30% to 0% in an hour while on flight mode. It even has network reception issues and a horribly unreliable speaker. I couldn't take any calls after landing from a flight because the speakers malfunction whenever they encounter pressure difference. Overall, my 4 year old OnePlus is working better than this phone. Extremely disappointed!

Very poor device from Samsung, I don't know why they were mocking Apple for iPhone. The face unlock doesn't work in dark. Figure print won't work with tempered glass on.

Camera is just fine nothing out of special.Even a 20k mi phone or other phones works fine if they are not used heavily and takes good photos in descent lighting.There is nothing special that this device offer in this price range.

Lagdroid Experience

Been using it for months now.Bought it thinking the gen1 would be efficient but no, it would eat up 100% battery in just 3 hrs along with the phone heating up with just normal use. Such pathetic phone from samsung,that too for 75k . Coming from 2 years of iphone usage , this phone has ui stutters and lags everywhere especially with the camera app which does software updates doesn't seem to fix ( although fandroids always say a software update would fix it ) . Clearing cache and other stuff should not be done manually by ourselves in a 2022 phone since a lot of fandroids keep suggesting it. Kept coming back to Android for 3 times now(bunch of 1+ phones ) thinking it would be better but now this will be the last lagdroid phone. If you have a lot a free time on your hands buy this phone .

For me this device is just like a landline phone, coz it's always attached to the power plug. Battery life is so pathetic that I have to charge it thrice a day. And this is when I'm using the phone moderately(no gaming and no video recordings). The battery can't even handle Instagram scrolling. If you have some apps open in the background and you are using Instagram, then 5% of battery will be gone in just 10 minutes. Overnight 15-20% is getting consumed which is highly irritating.

Battery is poor, no charger/adapter, phone heats up with just normal usage which isn't expected from a flagship phone. Camera is good though.Overall an average phone that is overpriced due to its brand name. If I could rewind the clock I'd go for a pixel 7.

Heating like a iron box

I never expected thermal management from a leading mobile phone manufacturer Samsung. Even for normal use while taking calls or switching camera ON.

Tried all the solutions, phone os is updated, phone not in lte mode and it is in wifi mode only, no use of it. Literally wasted 50k INR. Absolutely we consumers caught in the trap set by great amazon sale. Be aware and don’t believe reviewers of this phone. Please go for some other OEM.

The phone is good and doing great, but I am giving it a lower rating due to some expectations at this price.I was using Redmi but thought of using the flagship phone now but this S22 has two severe issues.1) heating issue. I feel like holding the stove in my hand.2) Battery drain issue. It's draining too fast even though the CPU usage is optimized, eye care enabled and all apps are in a deep sleep. It is hardly giving 8~12 hrs of battery life max.

Camera is awesome. Coming mostly as an user for iPhone for generations, this one is my first flagship possession from Samsung.Using iPhone 12, S22 comes at per in terms of Camera of iPhone 12 and I think it’s even better. Screen is much much brighter than iPhone 12. Performance wise is ok for me for emails, browsing and music. Can comment further with more time. Size wise is very convenient both to carry and also work. This fits in my phone tray in car and Android Auto is a charm with MID directions in Civic.What I hate is finger print sensor. It does not work most of the times with Spigen screen guard. After initial set up, I have stopped using it.

All good except battery life

I like everything about this phone except the battery. For all the power that is wrapped up in this phone, it's really light weight and it's one of the few phones that you can operate in just one hand for almost all tasks and transactions. There is no lag in day to day operations and everything feels smooth. The interface is intuitive as is expected of a Samsung phone. Call quality is quite good and I've so far not had any drops even in low signal areas. The look and feel of the phone is premium. From the photos taken so far there is nothing yet that is disappointing. I'm not an avid gamer and thus yet to test the phone for playing games. The battery juices out quickly but better life can be extended by setting screen refresh rate to 60Hz and switching off notifications for unwanted apps. In standby mode, battery does last long. All in all, this phone ticks all the boxes for me. At the current sale price, totally recommended.

There are many hidden problems in this phone.
","
This phone is overpriced for even discounted price (12,999/- for 6 GB variant). I purchased it because of past good experience with Samsung (Galaxy On6) but this phone cannot match the legacy. Samsung has done too much  unnecessary cost cutting on this phone.Camera: It has an average camera. It clicks decent photos and records good videos up to 4K 30fps, fhd 60. Only the main 50 MP sensor is usable, all others are present just for count. Camera has serious bug that it captures washed out colours if its AI detects a human face while using flash. If we remove human from frame, it captures just fine colours. Also, colours are just fine while clicking without flash.Front camera is pathetic from today's standard, it will just get you with video calls and nothing more, do not expect to use it for selfies with clarity. I do not click many pictures so I am okay with its camera.You can see this issue in the attached images, both the images were captured in low light with flash, the first one came out fine with colours close to actual object while the second one has completely washed out colours because the AI in phone detected human there. This unnecessary processing ruins the joy and there is no option in camera settings to turn this off. I have spent many hours trying to avoid this with different combinations of camera settings but it cannot be turned off. This bug might be embedded deep in the phone hardware as even third party camera apps ( I tried with OpenCamera) also give the same results.Battery : It can last for around 2 days with light to medium usage. It struggles to last one full day with high usage. Exynos 1280 is not efficient considering it is 5nm chipset. Also, the phone gets warm even with normal usage ( browsing etc) and gets somewhat hot during gaming.Idle battery drain is around 8-10% per night.It charges from 8% to 100% in 4:50 hours with 5 watt charger.With 7.5w (5v 1.5a) charger, it takes around 2:55 hours.Charges in around 2:15 hours with 15 watt charger (shows as fast charging).With 25 watt charger, the phone shows as super fast charging and charges from 5% to 100% in 1:24 hours.Display : Display seems smooth with 120 Hz, obviously not punchy as super amoled but it is okay and has good brightness for sunlight use and sufficiently low brightness for comfortable night use. Viewing angles are good. I did not face any issue with display and am okay with it.Buggy Auto brightness: Samsung has a habit of using cheap virtual sensors on its devices. This phone has virtual light sensors which is just a software solution to set screen brightness according to light present in room and using front camera as the light source. But this is seriously buggy in this phone, the phone does not understand difference between complete dark and dimly lit room. So, it will apply same brightness settings to both of these situations resulting unnecessarily bright screen in dark and uncomfortably dim screen in dimly lighted room. This sensor works poorly in outdoor as well. Most of the time, the brightness it applies to screen is not adequate.Software and UI: Samsung had installed may bloatware apps which are removable, One UI as everyone knows, is pretty user friendly. So, that is okay, however, Samsung should mention that this phone does not support some of the features such as S secure, bixby routines and sound assistant which are useful for some. Otherwise software experience is good, lag free.WiFi: It supports 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi at 1x1. So max of 72 mbps in 2.4 ghz mode and max 433 mbps in 5 ghz mode. This is the most basic wifi configuration possible. It can share wifi over hotspot which is nice. Although basic, wifi will not give any issue and has good range. So, wifi is okay.Bluetooth: I did not test bluetooth range but found it sufficient for my use. It can connect to two different  devices simultaneously. However, can play music in one device only. Did not find any issue with bluetooth.Mobile network: It has good 5g support with 12 bands but supports only 1 5g sim at a time. If we set one of the sims to 5g mode, the other one drops to 4g/3g/2g mode.It supports carrier aggregation and when tested, it was working with 3 band carrier aggregation with Jio.Call clarity is good and it can record calls without announcing to other person. virtual proximity sensor is not too bad.Fingerprint reader: For this price, the performance of side mounted fingerprint reader is good enough.We can register up to 3 fingerprints only which is limiting and not appreciated, at least 5 should be given.Face unlock: I guess it has AI based face unlock which works good even in low light condition. Although I do not know how secure it is.Storage and Memory: It has 6 to 8 GB of Lpddr4x RAM which is good for this price.128 GB storage used is UFS 2.1 which is not justified at this price in 2022 and lacks in performance when compared to UFS 2.2, apps take more time to install.Gaming: I installed call of duty mobile and it allowed settings up to medium graphics with very high frame rate and low graphics with max frame rate. In both settings, game was lag free and frame rate was always below 60 fps. So below average gaming. However, I do not play games, so, did not test with other games and do not care about gaming performance.Multimedia: Display quality is okay and single bottom firing speaker is average and audio from headset jack is fine, no complaints here.The chipset used in this phone supports h.264, h.265 video codecs only and does not support VP9 and AV1 codecs which is the most annoying downside. This means that it can play youtube only till 1080p and not in 2k or 4k because youtube supports h.264 up to 1080p only and we need vp9 and av1 support if we want to play higher resolution videos and if in future youtube removes h.264 support then this phone will not be able to play youtube at all. This is a very serious issue with this device. In future, all the streaming services will eventually switch to vp9 and av1 codecs as they provide better streaming efficiency and are royalty free, but as this phone does not support those, we cannot say this will be good for multimedia in future. So, 0 points for this in multimedia.Also, if we play youtube videos in browser like brave, it runs in software acceleration mode ( again, due to lack of vp9 and av1 capability) which loads up cpu and drains battery fast. Use youtube in either Youtube app or Newpipe to prevent unnecessary battery drain (as these apps play videos with hardware acceleration, which saves power). All this nonsense applies to other OTT apps (Hotstar, Prime etc) as well as almost all of them use VP9 codec for streaming which this phone plays in software mode, which shoot up the cpu usage and causes fast battery drain ( around 15-18% per hour).GPS and navigation : Works just fine. Has compass support.Pros:Two promised android updates and 4 years of security updates.Sufficiently good display with high refresh rate, feels really smooth.Good audio, WiFi and Bluetooth.dedicated memory card slot.base variant with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage which is good.Cons:Samsung cheaping out with no charger/cover/screen protector in box while competitors provide those.5g on single sim only. Competitors provide dual 5g in even cheaper phones.inferior UFS 2.1 storage is not good at this price, UFS 2.2 should be there.only up to 3 fingerprints.Buggy camera algorithm.cheap virtual proximity sensor.buggy camera light sensor.Exynos 1280 chipset claims to be having 5nm lithography which is good on paper, but in reality, its efficiency is on par with some 12-14 nm chipset and it heats under general use. Also, I don't understand why Samsung had to omit useful VP9 and AV1 codec which wouldn't even have costed them more as they are royalty free and Mediatek Dimensity 920 with same Mali G68 GPU supports those codecs. This has resulted the phone to be not able to play 4K and 2K resolutions on youtube.No HDR playback support.

Worst possible phone at this price segment
","
Please see screenshots.Storage: Storage speed test in Antutu seems to get score of 28000. When I asked customer chat in Samsung portal, they said it is EMMC 5.1.Battery: is 5830 mAh, not exactly 6000 mAh. Better not to cheat customers by marketing a 5830 mAh battery as 6000 mAh. Instead, give an actual 6000 mAh battery.Display: seems okay, but has some dark borders at all edges of display. Borders are thicker than other phones.Camera: at low light does not identify objects well.Overall, Samsung should work on giving more value at same price by providing either UFS 2.1/3.1 storage or amoled display.Battery life: doesn't come 2 days with moderate usage. Exynos processors need to efficient not only in terms of nanometers, but also in software-hardware optimization, which seems to be lacking.Will add updates if I find any after few weeks.Edit on 23 April 2022: Light sensor is not working correctly and quickly, and proximity sensor is working very slowly. Display is not visible under sunlight.Edit on 2 May 2022: Added more screenshots. Light sensor is not identified. One of the apps shows EMMC 5.1 as storage type. Feeling my money got wasted.Edit on 13 May 2022: Touch response and phone response both are slow due to EMMC 5.1 storage. At least they could have given UFS 2.1 for INR 15,999. Both 50 MP and front 8 MP cameras have the worst clarity and quality. Please refrain from buying this device. Too many compromises are done in this phone.Edit on 20 May 2022: There have been many fake reviews seen, probably to improve the rating and feedback. Do a comprehensive and deep research before deciding to buy. This phone is not at all recommended with the worst hardware configuration - No charger, worst cameras and proximity, light sensors.

Few drops of water makes you regret
","
So I bought this phone recently and while travelling on a bike few drops of rain might have entered the bag in which this phone was kept and next day screen started to act weird. There is not a micro level of water protection in the phone. The samsung store charged a hefty sum for the screen change and I still regret my decision to buy this phone, lured by good specs on the screen where the basic things are a miss.

Messaging, payment apps, office applications do not work
","
Hello everyone,I bought this phone because my previous phone completely broke.But been having problems with payment apps and office apps.Upon digging/Googling I understood that it is because messaging doesn't work on M series phones. We cannot save the messaging centre manually,  and it is probably a bug.I tried calling Samsung Customer,  I am hoping I will get a call back from them in a couple of hours and hopefully a fix.Truly truly disappointed, not what I expected from a 20000+ phone.Update:Got a callback next day from Samsung,  they want me to do a bunch of trouble shooting steps. If those don't work, I am to go to the nearest service centre.Please be wary before buying this phone.

Worst and laggy phone i ever used in my life. Also Samsung site got better rate than this
","
I made purchase then noticed 2k less on Samsung website. Anyway it’s my mistake so not returning it. Hope this will be fast one as it’s 6gb ram.After couple of days usage i am feeling bad on this purcgase. 6GB ram but i am not happy with speed of this. Skype too slow.4 cameras but its useless for taking photos of real use. If you just want to share it on social media then it looks awesome. But if i want to take a product photo and try to edit in photoshop its no where near to usable qualityAs its slow you definitely need tripod to get photos proper.Usage reviewIt's the worst phone i ever used and 6gb or 8gb ram is just a trap. It's useless as this phone is dead slow. If I click something i get something else. That kind of slow it is. Chinese brands with 2gb ram and below 8k budget got 100x speed  than this. To type this review it took me lot of time becaus it's issues.

My 4 year old Realme 1 is working much faster than this. Become worst just after android 13 upgrade. 6, 128 GB phone working like a 2, 16 GB phone. It's performance is worst may be due to exynose processor. I don't recommend. Better go for realme, redmi, OnePlus, iqoo etc.

Average performer
","
Recommended for house wives and mothers who use phone moderately (i mean, this phone is not good for heavy users).Reason for 2 star rating is that they didn't provide a charger and with the charger which i got separately outside, I'm facing slow charging speed and heating issues. Mobile company giants like samsung and apple are not providing chargers in the name of becoming ECO FRIENDLY, but doing this only adds to carbon footprint by these :1]new charger means new cover and new box for that charger2] additional new box and packaging material for shipping (@ online orders)3] additional fuel consumption by vehicles transporting the charger4]additional invoice means additional paper5] if the received piece is defective or not upto the mark, returns and replacements add more to all these.THIS BETTER STOP NOW.this new trend is as annoying as it's impracticality.If not for their charger feud, i would've given this 4-5 stars.PS: display is a drawback for this mobile but in the long run, you wouldn't notice any difference. So, i guess LCD display isn't much of a problem.

Call recording does not work when WIFI calling is enabled
","
I only bought Samsung for this particular feature ie, Call recording without the second party not getting to know I am recording the call. After the Android 11 release, every other phone company using Google dialer has to mandatory announce the call recording is in progress to comply with the GDPR laws of Europe. Only Samsung makes their dialers and does not use Google dialers by default, so they somehow circumvent this issue.But they did half-assed work.WIFI calling is an essential feature in the new phones. The network inside the homes is terrible in cities due to tower shortages. But when you enable the WIFI calling, this phone does not record, not manually nor automatically. Never knew this problem existed; even my old Oppo A31(android 9) has this call recording feature even if the WIFI calling is enabled. All Samsung phones, including this one, do not work. The Samsung forums have people complaining about this issue for the past two years, and still, there is no workaround from Samsung.I did not know about this problem. Otherwise, I would not have gone with this phone.Another issue, as everyone complained, is the missing adapter. It looks like Samsung wants to fool Indians by selling phones without adapters. I got fooled. It is going to give a bad reputation to Samsung. How good is a phone without an adapter? It's like buying a car without wheels.The phone is super heavy. It's not suitable for people with weak hands and muscular issues. Good as a hands-on weapon.Even though call recording has a severe shortcoming, the quality is good. It can be used as an everyday working phone with sufficient memory and storage.

Only for elderly people

Honest ReviewI bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly. Experience -1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.The voice focus function is good.5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.7. There are some really small good featureslike samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.No charger

 Fab phone...the display is not ambled but didn't bother me due to quality... it is super fast.  I bought the 8gb version. The look and back is stylish. It is light weight although not very slim from sides.The camera looks good with all the premium features like slo mo, portrait, macro, hyperlapse etc. The performance is super smooth. The new thing is side button finger print sensor. Easy to open. Face recognition is good. Rest will post after using some time. But in this cost, it looks super worth the money. Go for it!Edit:I am surprised why is everyone talking about charger.. we have n number of chargers floating in our houses from older phones and it is a good way of reducing e waste. Also, if they would give the charger and headset, the cost goes high. So may be Samsung can create it as an option for people who want to buy with extra cost. The features of the phones are premium, except Amoled display, but look at the cost.. I think it is a bargain.The phone is fantastic. I have been using since 3 days now, excellent battery backup- 2 days with normal usage (I don't play games), super smooth and fast, and 5g is awesome (use with wifi).Edit:Major audio bug that I am facing in this phone. I requested for a replacement and guess what the replacement phone has that issue too.As soon as I put an audio app to back ground...let's say I am listening a song or an ebook via headphone and I go to home screen, it creates a loud screach and very very loud voice. U will have to take off ur earphone.The biggest issue is the replacement didn't solve this problem. I would have to go to Samsung now. :(Don't buy. Not worth it. I was using M20 for 3 years before this and it was clearly better.

M33 5G THE UNDERDOG YOU WILL LOVE
","
Well i am writing the review after using this phone for nearly 10 days , we my experience is as follow1.OFFER HELP ME BUYINGi purchased this device in Rs 9400 in Amazon summer sale ( including all offers) refer image attached , So for me in this price range i think this is the best what i can get2. WHY  M33 5GWell This is my first Samsung device  in 10 years of using smartphone  & before buying there are lot of negative notion against this device  but as amount and offers are tempting so i decided to buy the device , BUT i can say there is lot of noticeable difference between this Samsung device and others from MI , POCCO'S & REAL ME (BEEFORE I HAVE REALME 6) well the difference are as follows2.1. the screen :- Lots of you tubers and electronic gurus told the screen is bad , etc. etc . but  as per my usage the screen is awesome not comparable to AMOLED but better than  all other group IPS panels , i like the 120 HZ scroll feature is great .2.2. Software:- In my home there are lots of MI, Realme devices and we all have one complaint in common that is bloatware, unwanted messages due to which whole phone experience go to waste coupled with Bugs in UI, So this time after buying Samsung M33 i get rid of lot of bloatware's and unwanted advertisement2.3 Built :- built is simple and solid , i like the Rugged built with Gorilla Glass 5 protection , Over all it is good2.4. Network Connectivity :- Samsung is  very old company in telecom  as compared to these new Age smart phone manufacturer, and believe me Samsung device are far far better in connectivity as compared to other my all old devices from chinsed manufacturer always struggle with network and connectivity issues  but this device is lot better if your prime aim is to communicate and do calls2.5. sound & speaker:- There is feature of clear sound in the phone ,which is good for long time calls & speaker is loud enough for You tube content consumption2.6. Knox security :- It is very good added advantage for secure online payment , as I am deal high on online payment then this feature have very required security for day to day money transfer2.7. Battery & Processor - Processor is snappy and highly responsive and combined with 6000mha battery due to this the device is long lasting hours of usageConclusion :- I am experienced  smartphone user and always emphasis that one should buy phone as per his  or her prime requirements and I found this Samsung device M33 a well balanced  smart phone and will recommend others to buy one because the There is no alternative to network connectivity and Knox security if we compared to other devicesTHANK YOU

There are many hidden problems in this phone.
","
This phone is overpriced for even discounted price (12,999/- for 6 GB variant). I purchased it because of past good experience with Samsung (Galaxy On6) but this phone cannot match the legacy. Samsung has done too much  unnecessary cost cutting on this phone.Camera: It has an average camera. It clicks decent photos and records good videos up to 4K 30fps, fhd 60. Only the main 50 MP sensor is usable, all others are present just for count. Camera has serious bug that it captures washed out colours if its AI detects a human face while using flash. If we remove human from frame, it captures just fine colours. Also, colours are just fine while clicking without flash.Front camera is pathetic from today's standard, it will just get you with video calls and nothing more, do not expect to use it for selfies with clarity. I do not click many pictures so I am okay with its camera.You can see this issue in the attached images, both the images were captured in low light with flash, the first one came out fine with colours close to actual object while the second one has completely washed out colours because the AI in phone detected human there. This unnecessary processing ruins the joy and there is no option in camera settings to turn this off. I have spent many hours trying to avoid this with different combinations of camera settings but it cannot be turned off. This bug might be embedded deep in the phone hardware as even third party camera apps ( I tried with OpenCamera) also give the same results.Battery : It can last for around 2 days with light to medium usage. It struggles to last one full day with high usage. Exynos 1280 is not efficient considering it is 5nm chipset. Also, the phone gets warm even with normal usage ( browsing etc) and gets somewhat hot during gaming.Idle battery drain is around 8-10% per night.It charges from 8% to 100% in 4:50 hours with 5 watt charger.With 7.5w (5v 1.5a) charger, it takes around 2:55 hours.Charges in around 2:15 hours with 15 watt charger (shows as fast charging).With 25 watt charger, the phone shows as super fast charging and charges from 5% to 100% in 1:24 hours.Display : Display seems smooth with 120 Hz, obviously not punchy as super amoled but it is okay and has good brightness for sunlight use and sufficiently low brightness for comfortable night use. Viewing angles are good. I did not face any issue with display and am okay with it.Buggy Auto brightness: Samsung has a habit of using cheap virtual sensors on its devices. This phone has virtual light sensors which is just a software solution to set screen brightness according to light present in room and using front camera as the light source. But this is seriously buggy in this phone, the phone does not understand difference between complete dark and dimly lit room. So, it will apply same brightness settings to both of these situations resulting unnecessarily bright screen in dark and uncomfortably dim screen in dimly lighted room. This sensor works poorly in outdoor as well. Most of the time, the brightness it applies to screen is not adequate.Software and UI: Samsung had installed may bloatware apps which are removable, One UI as everyone knows, is pretty user friendly. So, that is okay, however, Samsung should mention that this phone does not support some of the features such as S secure, bixby routines and sound assistant which are useful for some. Otherwise software experience is good, lag free.WiFi: It supports 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi at 1x1. So max of 72 mbps in 2.4 ghz mode and max 433 mbps in 5 ghz mode. This is the most basic wifi configuration possible. It can share wifi over hotspot which is nice. Although basic, wifi will not give any issue and has good range. So, wifi is okay.Bluetooth: I did not test bluetooth range but found it sufficient for my use. It can connect to two different  devices simultaneously. However, can play music in one device only. Did not find any issue with bluetooth.Mobile network: It has good 5g support with 12 bands but supports only 1 5g sim at a time. If we set one of the sims to 5g mode, the other one drops to 4g/3g/2g mode.It supports carrier aggregation and when tested, it was working with 3 band carrier aggregation with Jio.Call clarity is good and it can record calls without announcing to other person. virtual proximity sensor is not too bad.Fingerprint reader: For this price, the performance of side mounted fingerprint reader is good enough.We can register up to 3 fingerprints only which is limiting and not appreciated, at least 5 should be given.Face unlock: I guess it has AI based face unlock which works good even in low light condition. Although I do not know how secure it is.Storage and Memory: It has 6 to 8 GB of Lpddr4x RAM which is good for this price.128 GB storage used is UFS 2.1 which is not justified at this price in 2022 and lacks in performance when compared to UFS 2.2, apps take more time to install.Gaming: I installed call of duty mobile and it allowed settings up to medium graphics with very high frame rate and low graphics with max frame rate. In both settings, game was lag free and frame rate was always below 60 fps. So below average gaming. However, I do not play games, so, did not test with other games and do not care about gaming performance.Multimedia: Display quality is okay and single bottom firing speaker is average and audio from headset jack is fine, no complaints here.The chipset used in this phone supports h.264, h.265 video codecs only and does not support VP9 and AV1 codecs which is the most annoying downside. This means that it can play youtube only till 1080p and not in 2k or 4k because youtube supports h.264 up to 1080p only and we need vp9 and av1 support if we want to play higher resolution videos and if in future youtube removes h.264 support then this phone will not be able to play youtube at all. This is a very serious issue with this device. In future, all the streaming services will eventually switch to vp9 and av1 codecs as they provide better streaming efficiency and are royalty free, but as this phone does not support those, we cannot say this will be good for multimedia in future. So, 0 points for this in multimedia.Also, if we play youtube videos in browser like brave, it runs in software acceleration mode ( again, due to lack of vp9 and av1 capability) which loads up cpu and drains battery fast. Use youtube in either Youtube app or Newpipe to prevent unnecessary battery drain (as these apps play videos with hardware acceleration, which saves power). All this nonsense applies to other OTT apps (Hotstar, Prime etc) as well as almost all of them use VP9 codec for streaming which this phone plays in software mode, which shoot up the cpu usage and causes fast battery drain ( around 15-18% per hour).GPS and navigation : Works just fine. Has compass support.Pros:Two promised android updates and 4 years of security updates.Sufficiently good display with high refresh rate, feels really smooth.Good audio, WiFi and Bluetooth.dedicated memory card slot.base variant with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB storage which is good.Cons:Samsung cheaping out with no charger/cover/screen protector in box while competitors provide those.5g on single sim only. Competitors provide dual 5g in even cheaper phones.inferior UFS 2.1 storage is not good at this price, UFS 2.2 should be there.only up to 3 fingerprints.Buggy camera algorithm.cheap virtual proximity sensor.buggy camera light sensor.Exynos 1280 chipset claims to be having 5nm lithography which is good on paper, but in reality, its efficiency is on par with some 12-14 nm chipset and it heats under general use. Also, I don't understand why Samsung had to omit useful VP9 and AV1 codec which wouldn't even have costed them more as they are royalty free and Mediatek Dimensity 920 with same Mali G68 GPU supports those codecs. This has resulted the phone to be not able to play 4K and 2K resolutions on youtube.No HDR playback support.

Worst possible phone at this price segment
","
Please see screenshots.Storage: Storage speed test in Antutu seems to get score of 28000. When I asked customer chat in Samsung portal, they said it is EMMC 5.1.Battery: is 5830 mAh, not exactly 6000 mAh. Better not to cheat customers by marketing a 5830 mAh battery as 6000 mAh. Instead, give an actual 6000 mAh battery.Display: seems okay, but has some dark borders at all edges of display. Borders are thicker than other phones.Camera: at low light does not identify objects well.Overall, Samsung should work on giving more value at same price by providing either UFS 2.1/3.1 storage or amoled display.Battery life: doesn't come 2 days with moderate usage. Exynos processors need to efficient not only in terms of nanometers, but also in software-hardware optimization, which seems to be lacking.Will add updates if I find any after few weeks.Edit on 23 April 2022: Light sensor is not working correctly and quickly, and proximity sensor is working very slowly. Display is not visible under sunlight.Edit on 2 May 2022: Added more screenshots. Light sensor is not identified. One of the apps shows EMMC 5.1 as storage type. Feeling my money got wasted.Edit on 13 May 2022: Touch response and phone response both are slow due to EMMC 5.1 storage. At least they could have given UFS 2.1 for INR 15,999. Both 50 MP and front 8 MP cameras have the worst clarity and quality. Please refrain from buying this device. Too many compromises are done in this phone.Edit on 20 May 2022: There have been many fake reviews seen, probably to improve the rating and feedback. Do a comprehensive and deep research before deciding to buy. This phone is not at all recommended with the worst hardware configuration - No charger, worst cameras and proximity, light sensors.

Few drops of water makes you regret
","
So I bought this phone recently and while travelling on a bike few drops of rain might have entered the bag in which this phone was kept and next day screen started to act weird. There is not a micro level of water protection in the phone. The samsung store charged a hefty sum for the screen change and I still regret my decision to buy this phone, lured by good specs on the screen where the basic things are a miss.

Messaging, payment apps, office applications do not work
","
Hello everyone,I bought this phone because my previous phone completely broke.But been having problems with payment apps and office apps.Upon digging/Googling I understood that it is because messaging doesn't work on M series phones. We cannot save the messaging centre manually,  and it is probably a bug.I tried calling Samsung Customer,  I am hoping I will get a call back from them in a couple of hours and hopefully a fix.Truly truly disappointed, not what I expected from a 20000+ phone.Update:Got a callback next day from Samsung,  they want me to do a bunch of trouble shooting steps. If those don't work, I am to go to the nearest service centre.Please be wary before buying this phone.

Worst and laggy phone i ever used in my life. Also Samsung site got better rate than this
","
I made purchase then noticed 2k less on Samsung website. Anyway it’s my mistake so not returning it. Hope this will be fast one as it’s 6gb ram.After couple of days usage i am feeling bad on this purcgase. 6GB ram but i am not happy with speed of this. Skype too slow.4 cameras but its useless for taking photos of real use. If you just want to share it on social media then it looks awesome. But if i want to take a product photo and try to edit in photoshop its no where near to usable qualityAs its slow you definitely need tripod to get photos proper.Usage reviewIt's the worst phone i ever used and 6gb or 8gb ram is just a trap. It's useless as this phone is dead slow. If I click something i get something else. That kind of slow it is. Chinese brands with 2gb ram and below 8k budget got 100x speed  than this. To type this review it took me lot of time becaus it's issues.

Worst phone

My 4 year old Realme 1 is working much faster than this. Become worst just after android 13 upgrade. 6, 128 GB phone working like a 2, 16 GB phone. It's performance is worst may be due to exynose processor. I don't recommend. Better go for realme, redmi, OnePlus, iqoo etc.

Average performer

Recommended for house wives and mothers who use phone moderately (i mean, this phone is not good for heavy users).Reason for 2 star rating is that they didn't provide a charger and with the charger which i got separately outside, I'm facing slow charging speed and heating issues. Mobile company giants like samsung and apple are not providing chargers in the name of becoming ECO FRIENDLY, but doing this only adds to carbon footprint by these :1]new charger means new cover and new box for that charger2] additional new box and packaging material for shipping (@ online orders)3] additional fuel consumption by vehicles transporting the charger4]additional invoice means additional paper5] if the received piece is defective or not upto the mark, returns and replacements add more to all these.THIS BETTER STOP NOW.this new trend is as annoying as it's impracticality.If not for their charger feud, i would've given this 4-5 stars.PS: display is a drawback for this mobile but in the long run, you wouldn't notice any difference. So, i guess LCD display isn't much of a problem.

Call recording does not work when WIFI calling is enabled
","
I only bought Samsung for this particular feature ie, Call recording without the second party not getting to know I am recording the call. After the Android 11 release, every other phone company using Google dialer has to mandatory announce the call recording is in progress to comply with the GDPR laws of Europe. Only Samsung makes their dialers and does not use Google dialers by default, so they somehow circumvent this issue.But they did half-assed work.WIFI calling is an essential feature in the new phones. The network inside the homes is terrible in cities due to tower shortages. But when you enable the WIFI calling, this phone does not record, not manually nor automatically. Never knew this problem existed; even my old Oppo A31(android 9) has this call recording feature even if the WIFI calling is enabled. All Samsung phones, including this one, do not work. The Samsung forums have people complaining about this issue for the past two years, and still, there is no workaround from Samsung.I did not know about this problem. Otherwise, I would not have gone with this phone.Another issue, as everyone complained, is the missing adapter. It looks like Samsung wants to fool Indians by selling phones without adapters. I got fooled. It is going to give a bad reputation to Samsung. How good is a phone without an adapter? It's like buying a car without wheels.The phone is super heavy. It's not suitable for people with weak hands and muscular issues. Good as a hands-on weapon.Even though call recording has a severe shortcoming, the quality is good. It can be used as an everyday working phone with sufficient memory and storage.

Only for elderly people

Honest ReviewI bought this mobile for my father with the only intention of good battery life and samsung experience.It was my father's 1st smart phone. If you think I have only been written bad about samsung then no. Samsung is a good company. But they do skip on simple things which makes it a difficult buy.I would not divide the experience between pros and cons because it's really hard to divide it honestly. Experience -1.Battery is good, not excellent but good. Because the idle drain is crazy. I mean one time I used it and charged it 100% before sleeping. The morning when I saw the % it was 86% after 7 hours of sleep.2. Camera is less then average. What I only liked was portrait photos and macros. Normal photos are really super bright and it does not look good. Front is better then average but it paga in a low light. In good light it's better.3. Performance is good considering my father does not play any games. In a casual usage no bugs or lag. If you wanna play games and I mean on a regular basis and not like candy crush. I am talking about BGMI and COD please avoid this phone because it tends to heat a lott.4. You will suffer if you live in a low network area.The network bands are kinda not that good in detectating network. Ia mean it's really really bad.Call quality is 10/10 if you have good network condition.The voice focus function is good.5. There are no compass sensor nor proximity which after considering price is really a shitty decision from SAMSUNG. Its really struggle to find location.6. Screen quality is 8/10 in indoor condition. Outdoor the brightness sucks. Its difficult not impossible but difficult to see in direct sunlight. Even the auto brightness is very bad i mean very bad.7. There are some really small good featureslike samsung pay, protect battery which limits the charging capacity from 100% to 85% which improves the longitivity for prolong usage. Then there is also features which stops the phone from fast charging which again helps to improve battery longitivity. Speaker are good but again no stereo speakers.8. Finger print reader is 10/10. But again face unlock sucks.9. No charger. And the everybody buys charger.The environment policy of samsung is a cheap move.Tip - As per my recommendation this phone is purely for elders. Battery will easily last for more then 1 and ½ day.No charger

 Fab phone...the display is not ambled but didn't bother me due to quality... it is super fast.  I bought the 8gb version. The look and back is stylish. It is light weight although not very slim from sides.The camera looks good with all the premium features like slo mo, portrait, macro, hyperlapse etc. The performance is super smooth. The new thing is side button finger print sensor. Easy to open. Face recognition is good. Rest will post after using some time. But in this cost, it looks super worth the money. Go for it!Edit:I am surprised why is everyone talking about charger.. we have n number of chargers floating in our houses from older phones and it is a good way of reducing e waste. Also, if they would give the charger and headset, the cost goes high. So may be Samsung can create it as an option for people who want to buy with extra cost. The features of the phones are premium, except Amoled display, but look at the cost.. I think it is a bargain.The phone is fantastic. I have been using since 3 days now, excellent battery backup- 2 days with normal usage (I don't play games), super smooth and fast, and 5g is awesome (use with wifi).Edit:Major audio bug that I am facing in this phone. I requested for a replacement and guess what the replacement phone has that issue too.As soon as I put an audio app to back ground...let's say I am listening a song or an ebook via headphone and I go to home screen, it creates a loud screach and very very loud voice. U will have to take off ur earphone.The biggest issue is the replacement didn't solve this problem. I would have to go to Samsung now. :(Don't buy. Not worth it. I was using M20 for 3 years before this and it was clearly better.

M33 5G THE UNDERDOG YOU WILL LOVE
","
Well i am writing the review after using this phone for nearly 10 days , we my experience is as follow1.OFFER HELP ME BUYINGi purchased this device in Rs 9400 in Amazon summer sale ( including all offers) refer image attached , So for me in this price range i think this is the best what i can get2. WHY  M33 5GWell This is my first Samsung device  in 10 years of using smartphone  & before buying there are lot of negative notion against this device  but as amount and offers are tempting so i decided to buy the device , BUT i can say there is lot of noticeable difference between this Samsung device and others from MI , POCCO'S & REAL ME (BEEFORE I HAVE REALME 6) well the difference are as follows2.1. the screen :- Lots of you tubers and electronic gurus told the screen is bad , etc. etc . but  as per my usage the screen is awesome not comparable to AMOLED but better than  all other group IPS panels , i like the 120 HZ scroll feature is great .2.2. Software:- In my home there are lots of MI, Realme devices and we all have one complaint in common that is bloatware, unwanted messages due to which whole phone experience go to waste coupled with Bugs in UI, So this time after buying Samsung M33 i get rid of lot of bloatware's and unwanted advertisement2.3 Built :- built is simple and solid , i like the Rugged built with Gorilla Glass 5 protection , Over all it is good2.4. Network Connectivity :- Samsung is  very old company in telecom  as compared to these new Age smart phone manufacturer, and believe me Samsung device are far far better in connectivity as compared to other my all old devices from chinsed manufacturer always struggle with network and connectivity issues  but this device is lot better if your prime aim is to communicate and do calls2.5. sound & speaker:- There is feature of clear sound in the phone ,which is good for long time calls & speaker is loud enough for You tube content consumption2.6. Knox security :- It is very good added advantage for secure online payment , as I am deal high on online payment then this feature have very required security for day to day money transfer2.7. Battery & Processor - Processor is snappy and highly responsive and combined with 6000mha battery due to this the device is long lasting hours of usageConclusion :- I am experienced  smartphone user and always emphasis that one should buy phone as per his  or her prime requirements and I found this Samsung device M33 a well balanced  smart phone and will recommend others to buy one because the There is no alternative to network connectivity and Knox security if we compared to other devicesTHANK YOU

According to technician he said he will resolved the issue on call.....one application we installed that he want for testing purpose after that he sent screen-shot on my personal mobile number in that he had selected hardware issue and said that now you can return the product. But the main thing is I am unable to return this because there is no option available for this ...I tried to call the technician again, he is not recieving my call....so called customer care again....... we talked with customer care and what they said we will send the technician again...but we want our refund back but they forced me to send the technician again and repeat the process again.....But why should I do this process again this is not our fault.....I want my refund back.This product I had purchased for my mother and I have faced this problem.I request you all please don't buy this mobile or any mobile from Amazon... You can all face the same problem as we have faced....In logo paiso ki koi kadar nahi he. Ek person mehnat krk paisa kamata he or ye logo haram ki khane ki padi he.Kl se inke kisi family member ko gift de rahe he or problem ho ink sath bhi....tb inko pta padega.Meri batdua he in sbko ink sath isse bhi worst hona chahiye.....inka paisa or kisi chiz me nikalna chahiye.IF YOU WANT TO THIS PRODUCT OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT I RECOMMEND TO GO TO  THE GOOD MOBILE SHOP AND PURCHASE IT.....DON'T PUT YOURSELF IN THIS TRAP.Thank you

I had to replace the phone since it was stopping while playing videos and the touch wasn't working. I got a replacement phone and it has the same problems though touch is slightly better.

Worst mobile

The samsung and Amazon both fooled people.This is the first time I have tried to return a mobile and had worst experience with Amazon.Key Issues with mobile: Quickly device getting hot. Very much irritated during calls Battery drainage quicklyWorst Amazon support When I reached the CS support, they asked me to wait for a technical agent visit.  But the assigned technical agent left Amazon for more than year and I ended up co-ordinating with  CS support and that person.Again the next person avoided a personal visit and put me on a Minspect app and verified for few min. (Worst app at all and they promised for a personal visit but ended up on-call check)Again after a new call to the support team, they have agreed for a refund and asked me to update my pan card. But Again a new CS person refused that policy 🙄 🤔I don't know whether the intention of CS support is yo solve customer query or to time pass with us to feel irritated

mediocre laggy device
","
I bought this for my dad who is currently using M21 1st edition. Let me list down pros and consPros:1. 6000 mah battery2. Branded device. Current M21 is already running in android 12 from android 10. So future updates is not an issue. Atleast we can expect 2 major updates.3. Charger included in box (15w)Cons:1. Lag lag lag. Even the UI transition every thing is lagging like hell. I dont know how it passed QC. Basic operations like going to contacts, app view , setting everything lags like hell.2. Device feels heavy due to 6000mah battery3.  very very mediocre camera. Okaish output. I am not expecting output like iphone or samsung premium mobiles. But atleast equal to the competitors like redmi at same price range.4. They should move out of 15w charger to atleast 25w qualcomm support. Due to large battery capacity takes long time to charge device to full.5. Loading web pages with lots of images is going to be a problem. For e.g., some people have google news as default home page. For them its going to be really slow.6. Missing amoled which is thr in current m21.Verdict: If you need a branded device at 11 to 14k budget then go to this device. If not go to redmi 10s or iqoo or poco mobiles as they offer better value of money. As soon as I held the device it felt little bit heavy.

Don't buy it...I have bought phn from Amazon thrice...but in previous 2times there was no issue...now in the 3rd time I have bought this phn everything is alright but YouTube is lagging very much...so I went to the app and tried to return the phn...but Amazon didn't allow me to return the product as they were suggesting to book an appointment with their technician but they didn't have any technician present in this 1 week return time...so that's why I can't return the product now I have to use it...don't know whether it will show any more lags on other apps☹️☹️☹️so guys may be the price is low nd the offer seems good but I would again suggest u to think again before buying any phn not only this

Device performance

battery life, fingerprint reader are good. But there is lot of noise while taking foto in low light condition.One must also look the performance of the device. For the price range it's ok but there is drop in performance and frame rate while scrolling through Google news and youtube. Not only these there are lots of lag while using. I have been using m13 4g for 7 days. If you want to buy then go for the M13 5g model which offer more fluidity since it runs on MT D700 (7nm technology) which is more better performance  the exynos 850. Think carefully while buying.

Bought flip4 a month ago, last night left it closed on table and next morning I open and saw a black line at the centre, within few hours almost whole of the screen is having dead pixels. No drops, no mishandling, had bumper case and Samsung’s preapplied screen protector too, still this happened. Contacted customer care and they said it’s “impact damage”.. not sure what it meant even when the phone was not dropped. Worst part I have to pay for display change which will be about Rs30k. Poor quality display. Consider yourself lucky if phone lasts few months. Never recommend this phone to anyone. Thought Samsung products will be better but I was wrong and it’s costing me a heavy amount to trust Samsung. Should have gone for apple if I am paying such high amount with 0 reliability.

[Re]Z Flip4 Screen Black Spot in 2months
","
Order I''d: 1069092657The phone has never been dropped or banged or even scratched till date. 2 days ago, out of nowhere a black spot appeared on top right side of my phone. The image of the screen error has been attached for your reference.There are no signs of physical or water damage on the phone. There is not even a single scratch on the device. Even after this Samsung Service center refused repair the phone. According to the service center the handset is damaged due to improper usage. However, during my visit to service center they couldn''t find any signs of physical damage. Even after that they refused to give me benefit of warranty.I have Phone recording of Samsung official where they agreed that there was no physical damage in phone. Even after that the job report of service center states that the warranty is void since the phone was physically damaged due to improper usage. I will be sharing this recording in all social media websites so that every one will come to know how Samsung is cheating their Foldable Customers. Samsung official Gunjan Sharma was coordinating with me.I am sharing the photos of my device which clearly shows there is no physical damage till date.How come Samsung service center is refusing to repair my phone under warranty when it can be clearly seen that there is some fault with device.I don''t think I will buy any Samsung product again after facing such horrible experience even though I am one of their premium smart phone customer.I want my foldable device to get repaired under warranty as this is clearly faulty piece. Otherwise, I will definitely take this issue to higher level and even on social media sites so that people will know how faulty Samsung''s foldable devices are. Also, how poorly Samsung''s customer service treats their foldable customers.KINDLY TAKE THIS ISSUE AS MOST URGENT. I CAN DEFINETLY ASSURE YOU THAT ATLEAST PROSPECT SAMSUNG CUSTOMERS WOULD NOT BE BUYING THEIR NEXT PHONE FROM SAMSUNG.

This is way worse than previous model i.e. Galaxy A52 which is my other phone. Camera does not focus properly and at 2X it would never focus. You can not return as they keep sending technicians who will always tell you that it would be replaced/returned but they will send report that there is no issue. The technicians are bunch of idiots. Ultimately you will decide to keep using the phone because you can't keep doing this technician visit every weekend.

WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT
","
Purchase this or anything on Amazon at your own risk, customer support is not going to help.My unit had a physical defect, gaps on the sides from the back panel and it's a serious issue considering the phone is ip68 rated (water resistant) and this gap can cause water damage. Poor quality control as I saw some other customers reporting same issue and some units also getting water damage and then Samsung can't help there.First, they can't replace directly now. Some technician will visit and verify the issue however no one called or showed up and then I get an email saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Support Reps on chat are disconnecting the chat saying they can't do anything, there's a different team for these issues which is rude. It's been more than 24 hours and no one joined that chat and yet I was told ""I have option to keep this chat window open so have you can get connect with your concern team""Lastly, cherry on top is that they CAN'T change the address for the Technician's visit even if you're not at the same location where the order was delivered. Due to this, I had to wait 4 hours on a different location for the Technician's visit and no one came except for the email later saying ""Customer requested to reschedule"".Basically, you're on own after purchasing from Amazon. Think before making bigger purchases.Update: Still unresolved and denied further supportAfter a week of back and forth, finally a replacement was created however it wasn't delivered. For 5 days straight, it kept saying ""Now arriving today"" and ""Rescheduled"" and it's just stuck there.After countless hours with ~15 support and escalation agents (they all have technical issues when I ask a question), one of them canceled the order in hurry and now they can't create a new replacement order. Asking me to return the defective phone and place a new order which is by paying 6500/- more whereas I placed the order on sale for 23.5k. One agent promised that he'll refund the new order but he disconnected the chat and the next agent is not respective that offer.Currently, I'm stuck with the defective phone and support team disconnected the chat even while talking and said we can't help you anymore. That Agent also sent an email with numerous links pushing the survey links to bottom and interestingly, he modified the survey URL's domain from Amazon.in to Amazon.co.uk to avoid feedback and this was by the either by the Escalations or Leadership team.Not just the frontline Support team, Escalations and Leadership teams are also irresponsible and have such unethical and unprofessional behavior. Not to mention, no one wants to check the previous chats, you have to repeat every single thing all over again and I've done this for 2 weeks with more than 15 Agents.Next: I'm taking this social media and consumer forums.

Very very IMP to read if you are planning to buy S20 FE 5G - Known display issue
","
Ever wondered why this model is also sold a large numbers which are refurbished? Thats because it has a display issue which are noticed within one month of purchase and if such phone arrives at service centre they replace them with another one with new phone if bought from offline store (if bought from amazon then they will repair only and you need to live with it). Then samsung repairs the faulty phone and sells as refurbished by the dealers. Otherwise such a latest model wouldnt have so many refurbished phones.Now below is my purchase experience.I bought this phone on 11th Aug 22 and on 19th Aug the display automatically stopped working. Since Amazon provides replacement for 7 days so I couldnt replace - I dont consider myself as unlucky because its the problem with most of the Samsung S20 FE 5G models, and if you go to Samsung customer review site you can see many customers complaining about it globally. Also if you visit Samsung Service Centre in India and just sit there for few hours then high chances 1-2 persons would come with this issue.I mailed to Samsung, Amazon and requested for replacement since it was a manufacturing issue but no one listened, I twitted but no help - just some usual response came from both Samsung and Amazon. Amazon said since 7 days passed so they cant help. Samsung said they dont replace online bought products although they have 14 days replacement policy but that is only for offline products.I was frustrated and raised greivance at consumer forum but there also Samsung said they cant replace the product since its purchased from Amazon. And after no help I asked Samsung Service Centre to repair the product to which they said they need to check if it was a physical damange or liquid damage etc. and they first scared me saying it looks like I messed with the product but later agreed when managed to convince them sitting the whole day in the service centre. now they are saying the screen isnt available or they are not able to order. I am holding the dead phone for almost a month now. If you are planning to buy this phone then consider yourself lucky and learn from my pathetic experience and just dont buy this phone. Better buy any other phone but not Samsung's.

A Phone with known screen black dead problem! Stay away from Samsung.
","
I bought this phone with high hopes, it worked fine for few days, but within 2 weeks screen went black. On checking the samsung forums and amazon reviews, I understood this is a known problem and there are many customers, probably almost everyone facing this same issue who got it online. Now probably its my turn to go to service centre. I am really surprised to see Samsung neglecting customers that too S series buyers. There are some cases where consumers have raised cases vs Samsung but no response. I sincerely request Amazon to stop selling such items with known issues, as they spoil your reputation. I know Samsung is a big giant, so was Micromax and Lava at one point. We trust Amazon on their reliability and quality, but such incidents spoil the whole experience. I already told my friend to buy offline and go for Oneplus as don't want him to face this challenge.One day Samsung will learn and pay for their ignorance towards customers like us. Now there are thousands who will never buy Samsung just because of their experience with S20 FE 5G. A sensible company will recall such products from consumers or provide them a permanent fix.I too pledge never to buy a Samsung mobile in future.Update: Visited the Service centre and they replaced the display and returned the mobile same day in few hours. I have not got extended warranty as am skeptical how long the display will last, so better to cover for 2 years. Post which we can say that investment was spent over.The only good thing is Service centre had spare display ready(probably anticipating all S20 users will visit at some point). The Person ahead of me was also visiting the centre with same issue of same model, so its evident that its mass batch issue. Ideally Samsung should recall and withdraw such products from market. Anyway probably Samsung know better what to be done, but my next mobile will never be Samsung.

Don't buy this model

Please do not buy samsung phones. I have bought Samsung S20 FE 5G phone before 20 days. My phone display has stopped working working now. I have seen many videos on your tube then I realized that it is common problem in this phone. Samsung service center is accepting it is manufacturing defect. However company is not ready to replace the phone. There are saying that only repair is possible. Which is  I ma fine with. All I want in return that send me confirmation on mail that same issue will not arise in future but they are not even ready to take guarantee for their own product. (THIS IS WHAT THIS BRAND IS). I have put my hard earn money on this phone.  I have visited service center for 6 time and have called in customer number many times yet there is not solution. Please if any one can guide me how to escalate this issue. It would be very much helpful.Updates. I am following up the company since last 25 days yet there is no solution from their end.I am have done so many research on it. It is manufacturing defect Samsung service center executive has told me that. I have all the proof. I am planning to file complain in court now. They are selling sub standard products.

Substandard product from samsung
","
I purchased it on 24 sep and on 23rd October morning after charging, the screen went blank(BSOD) and I cant use the mobile. 23 and 24 are service center holidays and on 25 th service center after taking around 1 hr time and opening my mobile confirmed that display is gone and needs to be replaced. Displays are out of stock and asked for 4-5 days time. Having no other option and as return window is closed by 1st October, i agreed . Still in warranty, hopefully the display replacement is free of cost. I met other guy with same issue same model and same one month usage.Seems this is a sub standard product from samsung. This is my first phone from samsung and used mobiles starting from Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Motorola, One Plus..this is my first visit to any mobile service center in the last 20 years or so. Totally disappointed with samsung.Just hoping the replaced display will come longer.Huge discount on this model in sale , may be I should have not fallen. Bye bye samsung after this phone.Update:I got mobile back on 29th Oct and display was replaced free of cost as it was under warranty. But lost all my Data(which was informed) and had to setup again from scratch.Just hoping this will not happen again even after warranty.Pretty sure this is my last mobile from samsung. Bye bye.Update2:Iam seeing lot of reviews where in many mentioning its issue with Amazon purchased mobiles only, NO, I met 2 guys when Iam in service center and both had purchased from the same store where service center is located. So its issue with Samsung doesnt matter it is store purchase or Amazon.

Screen black out issue within 15 min of delivery.
","
I got the order on 27th evening. I opened the package inserted the sim and started the phone while selecting the wifi option the screen went black. Phone was having 58% charge it is vibrating or making sound if I try to charge it.Imediately contacted customer care they said technician will come and see what is the issue. and they will proceed for the exchange. If any one went through this please let me know what solution did you got from this ?Now waiting for the Technician. I will update how this process goes..Day 2.Appointmnet for technician was fixed after 2 days.slot was 10 am to 2 pm. got a text message from amazon that I will be there till 10.30am.but thechinical guy did not show up. tried calling CC they assured they will arange it till 2pm but it was not done they have booked other slot after 2 days again.Now waiting for the next day.  I will update what the day unfolds on that day.Amazon Policy : ( As described by amazon customer care )1. They can only replace or refund ( whatever option available ) when the techincal guy give there report  to the amazon.  And there have been many cases where technical guy have submited a wrong report to amazon at last  customer suffers in this case.2. Amazon dose not have any control over the techincal service.  They can't find out where the technical person is they can't contact them they even can't communicate  with them. I don't know how amazon approve this kind of Important service on which they dont have  any control.

Phone Screen went dead in 10 days after purchase!
","
Please do your research about the phone before you buy this phone.I bought this phone from Amazon during the Dussehra Sale Offer and I was quite happy with the Amazon fast delivery. But after 10 days of use, one morning the phone screen went blank n dead.  The phone was working as i could hear the incoming call ringtone and also the phone vibrate but mobile screen was blackout.So immediately I took the phone to the nearest Samsung service center and told them the issue. Initially they said don't worry sir since it's just 10 days from activation Samsung has complete product return n replacement policy. But then when I said it's bought from Amazon they said sorry sir in that case we just have only the warranty coverage and no complete replacement applicable! Also, when I was in the service center seeing my samsung s20 fe box fellow customers who also had similar problem called out to me asking ""oh! same issue ah!"". There were 2 customers with similar issue (phone screen blackout in few days from purchase) on that day.I feel something is not right about the Samsung s20 fe 5G as a complete product. Maybe some QA check's were comprised before the product market release. If it's just one-off instance of similar issue we can ignore and say like 1 in 100 issue can happen but that's not the case here. I asked the Samsung CC person how many such issues reported, she said with a smile, yeah quite a few similar customer issues reported!

Black screen of death
","
Bought this during one of the sales for a decent amount of discount. But within a month of buying this phone the screen stopped working. It just went blank while I was browsing. I thought the phone shut down and kept trying to turn it on. But it wasn't responding. So I started removing the sim to put in a different phone and the phone made a sound as soon as the tray popped out, that's when I realised the phone is on but the screen had shut off.After some googling I found that this is fairly common for Samsung phones. It's been happening for many years and Samsung hasn't bothered to fix it. If only I had known this before buying the phone...This had even happened to my father's phone some 5 or so years ago. But it started back up after the phone battery discharged completely a day later, and didn't have a problem after that so brushed it off as a one off issue and didn't really look into it too much. Wasn't as lucky with this phone, will be going to a Samsung service center soon, lets see how that goes.Wanted to buy Samsung foldables in the future, but hesitant of Samsung phones in general now. Especially since this is a fairly frequent issue and they haven't bothered to fix it after so many years. And foldables have their own screen issues as well.Until this issue cropped up I was fairly happy with this phone. I would have given it 4.5 stars. One point that did bother me a bit was the weight. This thing is heavier and bulkier in hand than the M52 that my father has, despite having a smaller battery. I guess it is the better cameras and a metal frame addibg some weight. Premium touches no doubt, but the M52 is a bit more comfortable to hold in the hand and it has a marginally bigger screen and battery.  Anyway not a big deal, it was a good phone overall.

The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Just in 2 days after delivery
","
The screen goes black out and phone is  not geting start. Phone was delivered on 02/10/22 and stopped working on 04/10/22. Phone screen gose completely black out suddenly while using. And now not starting. I tried to replace this via Amazon app but the option is not available their the only option is to get the technician visit and the slot is not available for technicain visit. After calling the Amazon customer care i got appointment for 07/10/22.I am editing this review today on 14/10/22 now my phone is replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Amazon and their customer support team. Now my phone is working fine.But i have one doubt if i i have got the new phone or not. The box was sealed but when I opened their was some dirt stick on the phone. As the phone screen guard was their. Also the charging adaptor was not properly at its place.  It seem that in transit these was displaced. But generally this dose not happen. As the package is made in such a way to avoid these displacementI want to ask Samsung and Amazone if they are supplying phone with screen guard applyed on Galaxy S20FE 5G. And durt on the screen guard. Is it standerd from Samsung. I think definitely not. Request Amazone and Samsung to clearify this. I have a doubt the phone i got is refurbished. I request Samsung to clearify my doubt by checking the sl no. And IMIE no. In their records.

FE means Fool's Edition
","
Screen - So-called Samsung's AMOLED is hype. It took me a lot of time to adjust to this screen because the colors are inaccurate.I'm using vivid mode with the white balance slider turned all the way to the right, i.e. warm.120Hz is a gimmick on this phone. You are forced to use it because 60Hz is unrealistically laggy. Compared to the aged Pixel 2XL, this phone is in no way faster by any means.Moreover, the refresh rate is not adaptive, therefore, battery drain is horrible.Speakers - Average, lack natural bass. The overall sound is on the sharper side.Battery - Poor. Don't trust screen on time. You have to charge it twice a day. I don't know what kind of a person is ""mild"" in this day and age.Performance - Software is poorly optimized. Performance is not good. It doesn't feel like a flagship.No headphone jack, but that's okay, nobody likes music anymore.Expandable storage - This is the only pro, everything else is a con. They removed this one too in S21 FE.Camera - Why do people say colors are subjective? Who purposefully likes unnatural oversaturated greens of foliage, exaggerated reds, and blues which look like they are painted on with a double brush?The overall photo is childish and basic. Compared to the Google Pixel 2, this camera is crap.And the camera app lags like crazy. It takes irritatingly long to get into the camera app, for it to be ready for clicking a shot.Ultrawide cameras are all gimmicks, so much more especially in this phone.Telephoto lacks resolution.The video quality is decent.The fingerprint sensor is horrible. Painful, really painful. You will curse it.Software - Thankfully no ads but miles away from the stock experience. Even though it has 865 SD, it feels like a middle-range phone. No, the software is NOT snappy. There are no glaring lags either but just not what you would expect. Or perhaps my expectations from a Samsung phone are unreasonable. Updates ain't so fast either. Samsung treats FE models as an afterthought.Bottom line - Don't buy this phone even if it sells for a single rupee above 30K. I made a mistake. Look elsewhere, don't be fooled by a ""near-flagship"" experience because there is none.

Samsung Fan, Good Phone, SCREEN BLACKOUT,  Great Camera
","
I have brought this phone on august 2022 on sale for 28600, That was a great deal for this phone and I have never seen this phone in this price range. I feel heating issue at first 2 days of use  while charging, streaming Youtube and playing games(BGMI). But after software update it seems fine and doesn't have that much heating issue any more. overall the phone looks good, camera is great and a descent battery life (1 day life with streaming + browsing + call ), finger print scanner is ok not that best in market. Battery wont be enough if you are a gamer.The real issue came after 3 months of use, one day the SCREEN got BLACKED OUT while using message app. I m a Samsung fan and I have been using Samsung phone's for around 15 year. This is the first time I m facing such an issue( only freezing issue found in previous phones ), it can be restarted but screen will be blacked out after a while. and it got fixed by SCREEN REPLACEMENT from service center. And the ISSUE is there for more users who PURCHASED on SALE DAY, some people already logged this in Samsung community. Only because of this I'm giving this phone a 2 star review.

Very disappointed product from Samsung
","
Very very disappointed, I never expected this kind of product from Samsung.Within 20 days (accurately after 17days of usage), the phone suddenly showed a black screen even though vibration and other things were working in the background. The black screen was not resolved even after trying hard booting many times. Since it was more than 14 days Service center team member told me that it can't be replaced but can be repaired.After an initial investigation, it was communicated that it is a defective piece. The screen and battery needed to be replaced. The estimated service time was 1 day.The next day when I enquired, they told me that the parts are not yet arrived and it will take 2 more days, Hoping that there will be no further delay.I never faced this kind of problem with Xiaomi phones before, I think I made the wrong decision to switch to Samsung phones. It has caused so much trouble as I am not able to authenticate my authentication on some of the cloud portals due to this issue.The only good point which made to buy this phone was the camera quality,  But what is the use of having a good camera when the phone itself is very unstable and has a black screen issue?

Camera clarity not good, even six years old  redmi note 6 has better camera then this I mean you can't compare its worst.

Problem with Amazon

I have been using Samsung products since 2007. First time unhappy with Samsung Galaxy S20 FE due to Amazon. Amazon is buying defective products and selling with little lower price than market. I would suggest not to buy Smart phones through Amazon.

Shocking poor build quality
","
Bought in Jun 2022, delivered on 25th Jun, I find this hardware button to be broken/disassociated on Nov 5, 2022. Lucky for me, the part got lodged in my pocket and I could put a cello-tape and sort of fix it (jugaad). However, this has convinced me to not go with Samsung products anymore. The quality is deteriorating. BTW, the phone never fell from my hand, had a protector almost immediately. Now of course, Samsung will claim I (or my kids, or somebody else) MUST have dropped it. I have spent too much of time setting this up, and I can't give it to anybody without a huge inconvenience.Photo taken on iPhone bought in Feb 2021, (for context), fell twice till now, also has protectors, going strong.

Not a good deal

It's been one month since I got trapped.1. Battery life is average. It takes a lot of time to get fully charged. If u use the phone while charging, it will take more than 5hrs for fully charged2. Back camera is very nice, but selfie camera is waste. U can't make quality reels and u will look like chudel in video calling. No flash for selfie camera in this price range.3. Touch is just ok.4. Phone is a bit heavy.5. Not worth for 30k at all. Think twice before you buy this 🤔.Note - I listed it on OLX already

With this price go with one plus
","
The price at which you are getting this phone...... you cab go with one plus either....one plus has good battery backup with fast charging support... even after spending 30k on Samsung we are not getting fast charging support...it only offers 25w that too you have to buy adapter separately.The seller has taken away too much time to deliver as well... no issue with product recevied the product in best condition.

Mobile suddenly and silently stopped display. Don't recommend this model.

I brought this mobile few days before Dusara festival as I had my old MI mobile and wanted a new one. Thought to buy Samsung as it is very popular one and went for this Samsung Galaxy 20 FE. Used it for 2-3 weeks very carefully as it was new mobile and wanted to keep it safe till Diwali at least :). I had my personal data and office apps on it. 2 days back i kept it near me and was doing office work. had to call my colleague for urgent work in the weekend and this mobile stopped display and had to suffer a lot as i had my office app, contact numbers etc and even UPI apps on it.now i am unable to return it from AMAZON website. Need to call Samsung customer care...don't know how is the support from Samsung. I would suggest not to go for this model.

Extremely disappointed with the Battery
","
The phone is great in many aspects; I purchased it even after reading about its average battery life, but I’m highly disappointed after 1 week of usage even after starting with low expectations.I charged my iPhone 12 and Samsung S20fe to 100% last night and left them on my desk when I slept; this morning when I woke up, the iPhone is still at 100% whereas Samsung is at 92% (after 8 hrs of no usage)On normal days (with screen on time of 2-3 hrs) the battery doesn’t even last till the evening, and this is despite 60hz refresh rate and turning off several battery consuming features like NFC, nearby device scanning, location, Auto app updates, several personalisation features. I checked in the setting and it says 3% was used by google play services, 1% WhatsApp and % Samsung store. I’ve set all of these apps on the most minimalist modes, and yet have this battery drain.Regret buying this phone. Feels like Samsung and Amazon sold me lemon by discounting it heavily

Wondering if it's a flagship!

This doesn't come with 25w charger and headsets out of box for such premium price.You have to buy it manually.Usb C to 3.5 jack adapter from samsung only works, if you like to use existing headset, so that's an additional purchase.If you're buying in 2022, you may get android update in Mar 2023 and security update till 2024.Observing heating issue while charging with regular 15w charger.Hope this helps!

In call sound is so loud. It's irritating. Don't buy this phone unless you are going to use headphones/headsets/earbuds,etc.  everytime while speaking. Or if you can use loudspeaker..And remember they have aped Apple hence no 3.5mm jack slot. Either Bluetooth or wired headset with type c cable.

Reviewing after 2 months of usage as my Primary device..
","
This is totally my personal opinion about the phone, there are too many aspects to talk about and it will definitely help you with your buying...1. Look and build: (8 out of 10)  Firstly it is a good-looking phone for me, simple and sober, with a metallic frame the phone feels good on the hands too, back made of plastic and not too prone to scratches, even I dropped it a couple of times but it is fine as of now. So the plastic build is a key for those who don't use covers. but you must regret not having a 3.5mm jack.2. DIsplay: (7 out of 10) To be honest display is good but not as good as other Samsung flagship, I was using it along with the Samsung S9 and Realme X2pro side by side on 1080p resolution but the s9 and X2pro look more sharp and bright as compared, Pixel density and brightness nits are satisfactory but not issue in outdoors. overall the display looks good.3. Performace:(7 out of 10) It is the key part for me, with regular day-to-day tasks, multitasking app switching everything is fine unless it comes to gaming. the device comes with SD865 and on paper, it is a very good  SOC for performance and for gaming also, but Samsung doing it very wrong in the part of gaming, I m daily driver Bgmi player and I play it a lot, in the term of gaming performance it works really poor as compared to my Realme X2pro with SD 855plus. with the smooth extreme setting, there are high Visible frame drops and stutters. frames drop as low as 40-35 fps as compared to X2pro which continues to maintain 55-60 fps. Samsung does not work well on gaming optimization. So as my view who looks for a good gaming phone go for Realme Oneplus or other but if gaming is not that matter then definitely go for this.4. Camera:(9 out of 10) It is another key point for me, the camera performance on this phone looks excellent, I am fond of photography and for me, the camera works really well on color balance dynamic range, etc. wide-angle camera and portrait mode is excellent and the sensor works really good on low light conditions. the primary sensor OIS works really well but Video mode with the wide-angle lens is missing. Samsung must add it with updates. Overall the camera is really good.5. Battery: (8 out of 10)4500 mah is kind of enough for a mid-user. it typically lasts for a day most of the time. Battery management and optimization are good. But for the heavy users with heavy app load and background load the phone needs to charge more than one time a day.6. multimedia:(9 out of 10) Videos and movie watching experience is fun on this as the volume is loud and the Dolby sound and stereo effect works really well.7.UI:(8 out of 10) Samsung One UI looks clean and good but comes with lots of preinstalled bloatware ( some of them are uninstallable ) and adds( can be disabled while device setup or from the settings) and Android 11 and Samsung Nox security is a key part of this phone as the device comes with hardware base extra layer of security. and Samsung is good at pushing regular security updates and 3 years platform update. and it makes the device future-proof.8. Network reception:(9 out of 10) I am using airtel as primary sim. there is not carrier aggregation in my area. but devices support it also it supports Vowifi and dual-band WIFI so no issue with the network reception.I brought it for 41k with an extra 7k discount. and it kind of value of money for me because of the Brand name. and it is a really good phone from Samsung. but in this price segment, and there are lots of other options to look for.

Bought this for Rs 26500 and worth every penny
","
Even though this phone was launched 2 years back but 865 processor is still worth Rs 26500. The Camera is just amazing! other mid-rangers like M52 , A52s etc. are not even close.The battery is decent but since my usage includes normal day-to-day functions - WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome,5-10 photo clicks and some paytm types app and I set the refresh rate to 60Hz, I am able to use it for 2 days easily on single charge. The phone comes by default with screen guard which is not tempered glass but does provide some protection. The back cover is glasstic and needs some protection, Either the phone cover is such that or best is to get a film protection for its back as well just like screen.Overall Battery is 8.5/10(For normal usage where 60Hz refresh rate is also fine)Camera is 10/10, front Camera  =  9/10Performance for normal user = 10/10(Not sure about gamers)In-Hand Feel is perfect= 9/10Screen Quality  = 10/10

Amazon screwed up delivery for the first time. I cancelled and ordered again after a week availing exchange offer. Plus, got discount on using a certain credi card. For 25k, this is a fantastic phone. The camera is outstanding. I have a DSLR and can confidently say that this pictures from this phone are as good as that, quality wise. Thanks to 8GB RAM, the phone functions smoothly. The screen resolution is top notch. I read a lot of complaints on screen conking off after few days. It's been 10 days since I have been using the phone. Thankfully, no issues for me yet. Hoping for the best 😄 The phone charges very quickly and battery life is very good for a moderate user like me who doesn't watch too many videos or okays games. Overall a fantastic phone at this price range. Go for it 👍👍

S20 FE 5g is very good product. I like the look and feel . Its real nice. Network connectivity is excellent. I get good 4G plus network.  5g is still not launched in my city. So can't talk about 5g. Bettery optimisation is very good. And nothing to say more about the software experience.  Its Samsung One UI. Just Great , no lag , no bug . I find it like this. So finally it a very good product by Samsung.

Best Midrange mobile at 30k
","
Bought this for 30k (In prime sale + Bank offers and No COST EMI).Screen: Absolutely stunning, it supports 60Hz and 120Hz. It doesn't switch automatically between these settings, you need to select it from settings.Rear Camera: Really nice, seriously good. Not just good enough.Front camera - A bit disappointed, it's good but not as good as rear camera.Performance - You can play games like Call of duty or BGMI at Max graphics settings that the game supports. It heats up a bit after playing for a hour. Which is absolutely normal considering it has Snapdragon 865 and as saying goes with great processors comes a little bit of heatings. Just know that it's normal, don't expect any mobile to not heatup while charging or doing heavy works. That's universal.Finger Print reader - Good, no complains. Won't feel any significant delay or issues.Charger - It comes with 15W USB type C charger and it takes 1 hour 30 minutes to fully charge the battery. Mobile however supports upto 25W charger and it also supports wireless charging which I haven't tested. Don't buy a separate 25W charger for this, because the 25W charger takes only 10 minutes less than 15W charger to fully charge it.Sim cards - Supports 2 5G sim cards and upto 1TB (confirm this) expandable storage. However the slot is hybrid, it means you can't use both sim cards and external memory card at once. Either use both sim cards or 1 Sim card and external memory card.I don't think you will need external memory card because it has 128GB internal storage which is enough for normal users.It comes with Android 12 and Samsung one UI 4.1 and will support updates upto Android 13.It doesn't have headphone jack.Box contains - Mobile, Charger and Charger cable. Sim ejector.Amazon usually have discount (without prime sale), so don't buy without any discounts.As of August 2022, Expect it around 30k to 33k. Don't buy above this price because it randomly comes down to this price on some days.Personal suggestion: buy a cover ASAP. I droped it next morning and fortunately nothing broke, got a scratch around camera bump. Camera bump is made of glass-ish stuff and it can break very easily. So just keep that in mind.

I have recently bought this phone on 16th June. Unfortunately this phone has a high charge drainage issue and does not stay for even 1 day long. Hence, I requested a replacement for the same. But even after one technician visit I did not receive any replacement though he said that the phone has this issue. After this, 5-6 technician visit has been cancelled by then repeatedly and they are claiming the cancellation is from our side. This is horrible experience that I never expected from a renowned e-commerce store like Amazon. Please avoid to buy this phone

This is way worse than previous model i.e. Galaxy A52 which is my other phone. Camera does not focus properly and at 2X it would never focus. You can not return as they keep sending technicians who will always tell you that it would be replaced/returned but they will send report that there is no issue. The technicians are bunch of idiots. Ultimately you will decide to keep using the phone because you can't keep doing this technician visit every weekend.

It was on sell at 33k by the time of my purchase. Brought it reluctantly but also because the review showed 60-70% positivity.When the product got delivered, the packaging was not very good however I got the original box, original charger, original cable and Sim ejector. Honestly I would have been okay even if they had included a bad charger since I was already getting a good deal.The phone came neat and clean... almost new! No visible signs of wear and tear. I was actually surprised.The camera is first class, battery average, features excellent. No compromises on the 33k charge. See you again after 6 months

Literally bought a brand new phone of 56k for 36k. Except that the box was open, everything in the box was BRAND NEW though it was called 'Renewed'. The battery life just keeps getting better and better with each passing day as the phone understands your usage patterns. Display is outstanding. Yet to see how the 5G networks perform. Trust me, if you want to buy this phone, go for the RENEWED ones. This is probably the best phone in the world you could buy for less than 40k. Very very satisfied.

It was on sell at 33k by the time of my purchase. Brought it reluctantly but also because the review showed 60-70% positivity.When the product got delivered, the packaging was not very good however I got the original box, original charger, original cable and Sim ejector. Honestly I would have been okay even if they had included a bad charger since I was already getting a good deal.The phone came neat and clean... almost new! No visible signs of wear and tear. I was actually surprised.The camera is first class, battery average, features excellent. No compromises on the 33k charge. See you again after 6 months

Literally bought a brand new phone of 56k for 36k. Except that the box was open, everything in the box was BRAND NEW though it was called 'Renewed'. The battery life just keeps getting better and better with each passing day as the phone understands your usage patterns. Display is outstanding. Yet to see how the 5G networks perform. Trust me, if you want to buy this phone, go for the RENEWED ones. This is probably the best phone in the world you could buy for less than 40k. Very very satisfied.

Worst mobile phone

Very poor product. Just forget about the Camera quality. A lot of noise and color variation you will find in the images taken out with this. Especially the front camera, a cheap webcam can take a much better image than this. Just see the noise, brightness issue and color variation in the shirt shown in the image(shirt is a very light colour one but it is coming entirely different in this image and no details of it). Camera is also very laggy in preview mode.Beware that this product once purchased can't be returned or replaced. Amazon will right away deny that mentioning about their policies. Think twice before buying this. In terms of other performance it is somewhat ok but not justifying the amount that we pay for. There are better alternatives available for 19k available from other manufacturers. Quality of the product is not at all justifiable from this price point.

Battery life is superb.Look is good.Other than that connectivity issue-the other person is always unable to hear clearly whenever I make a call(Only WhatsApp calls help).Camera is not that good. You can only expect good pictures when you have good lighting, otherwise forget about good pictures during the night or low light area.Sensor is moody, if it wants to work it'll work if it doesn't wants to, then even after multiple attempts, it'll not read the finger print.Processor is bit slow.  Sometimes gets stuck for several minutes.Overall-Not worth the penny.

Don't go with only the written specs and compare with cheaper fones, quality matters a lot! Trust me.On paper, it is inferior in specs as compared to other brands, and other samsung online-only phones, but This fone is far better in quality than any fone I have used so far. (I have almost always used mid range fones)Pros:1.Good battery life and outstanding stand-by battery ( u sleep at 60%, u get 60% wen u wake up)2. Reception Including Bluetooth is excellent.(I can use use my Bluetooth earphones from next house also! )3. Very premium feel and very smooth touch.4. I don't know how, but this tft display is much clearer and better than many amoled displays of the same range .5. 3yrs of android updates and 4yrs of software updates!6. Samsung charger In the box, u like the online only variants(though it's a 15w charger)Cons:1. Little overpriced maybe...1000to1500 rs, but it compensates for it in the luxury feel, tough built and gorilla5 glass.2. Takes longer to charge since it's upto 25w charging, but I charge the fone once in 2 days, coz it consumes very less power, even while playing gamesDon't listen to the so called you tubers tho are not the real experts on the matter. If you have been using Chinese fones like redmi/realmi/oppo etc then u will surely enjoy this fone , it's smoothness and the premium feel/looks.

Worked for 2 years without no issue. After 2 years serious problems- charging issue, display issue etc. New dosplay panel was replaced in authorised samsung service centre by paying around 11223/-. Within 7 days the display panel again created the same problem. There is no authorised service center in my current city. The online samsung customer support is giving round-round reply without any solution. I purchased this mobile specially due to stylus feature. Unfortunately, no other brand (Nokia, Motorola etc) is providing smartphone with stylus feature. Samsung is using benefit of this and looting customers. I have already used Note 2, On max mobiles but my experience with note 10 lite is pathetic now. This is making me not to stick on SAMSUNG products only.

never ever puchase this mobile

This is a product of out of country so samsung support centre doesn't take responsibility of it. Either charger not working or there's problem with battery, very poor

Do not buy it guys it's a trap.

I bought this phone during first lockdown in 2020 basically with a curiosity of the experience of stylus..I was using Oneplus 6 before this, so you can understand what my expectation from this device..Since the beginning the phone was a bit slow.. Even reaching to internal memory i8t used to take time which is hard for me as I was an oneplus user.. I started living with that buffering issue..Usually, when I was using one plus, I was waiting for the software updates as they usually simplify my tasks.. but it is different with SAMSUNG..Few of my OTT channels started going haywire in the month of Feb'21..By this time it is only 9 months old mobile..I used to screw the happiness of HOTSTAR customer care.. I didn't know that this is the problem with mobile but not the OTT.Then, I had this problem of contacts not appearing in mobile..For example, my wife's name is not appearing when she calls me, neither I can see her number in my contacts..Thr funny thing is that, when I called the customer care and informed about my concern.. they access my phone from smart tutor app n say that that particular number is not saved in my contacts..That number is off my wife who is living with me for the last 15 years..And remember.. do not expect to use the phone while it us bring charged.. It'll never respknd. Or will over react..And..lastly.. The issue with over heating..I'm jyst wondering how come SAMSUNG become the number two top seller in India and how people are living with it...l

After 6 months of use:1. The fingerprint sensor sucks. Works 1 out of 5 times, and that too if I keep the finger with great precision. The face recognition works fine but is slower than most phones.2. Battery life is satisfactory. Phone gets super hot, even if you are using it for regular calls and msgs.3. Charging: I love how fast this devices charges up. Superfast.4. The camera is not that good either. Even Vivo/ Oppo provides a better camera at a lesser price. Lacks stability once you zoom in.5. Poor Speakers for watching videos. My previous phone (oneplus5) had better speakers. Even while using speaker phone while on-call; it's just not loud. I mean you can obviously hear the voice, but don't expect that in a room of 5 people, everyone can hear it clearly.6. Processor: Slower than what it should have been. Not sure why they used Note 9's chipset and not the one that they used in S10 lite. Phone's efficiency could have been better if they used a newer chipset in note10 lite.Samsung uses cheap Exynos processor in India.Why buy?Buy this phone only if you want to use the stylus for sketching / taking notes. All other features that are marketed for S pen, are useless. But weigh out your options well - If S-pen is more important than camera/ fingerprint sensor/ phone speed/ battery life/overall performance, then only buy note 10 lite. Else go for any oneplus flagship phone.Conclusion:Personally, After using this phone for 6 months, I think One Plus8 would have been a better option at similar price. And now with newer phones out in market, I think Note 10 lite's price should be reduced to 20k max. Features and performance ain't worth the current price (39k / 35 k post cashback offer).Good luck buying your new phone :)

I have been using this mobile for the past six months before writing this review, earlier I used Honor 7x and I thought I am upgrading myself to a better phone and bought this. Overall the phone doesn't even deserve Rs 4000 pricetag.Switching off frequently - This is the one most common problem, while I'm in-office calls or even when the phone is idle it switches off by itself and then reboots itself. This is one most annoying things you can face on your phone. When I was making a presentation through the mobile, It got switched off and finally, I had to pay the price of buying such a crappy product.Useless fingerprint scanner  - After the first few times, the fingerprint scanner hardly works. I don't remember when I used that facility, whenever I try using finger print it fails miserably.Battery: With Android Auto on for 1 hr, you can expect the charge to come down by 15-20% and If I charge in the morning, I have to recharge by evening.Frequent updates: Software updates come almost every week, it is so annoying if we have to update the phone so frequently.Almost with thrice the cost of my earlier phone , this product delivers way worse than it. Probably this is the first time I am writing such a negative review for a product.Avoid it, at any cost - don't even recommend it for your enemy !!!

10 days average Usage review.

Like most of the reviews suggested, stay away if u want a decent selfie cam. Fingerprint reader is a disaster. Somehow my 2yr old phone had better jio and Vodafone 4g signal reception than this phone. Phone came with screen guard applied and Android 11 OTB. Processor and ram will surely lag a little. cannot uninstall some bloatware. My first amoled phone. I think it's overrated. Good quality FHD IPS are the same.After 2weeks use:Signal reception is poor for jio and Vodafone idea compared to any other mobile. Fingerprint reader is nearly useless. Can't enrol more than 3 fingers, since it's suggested to double register a finger, u can practically use only two fingers.Face recognition is not useful except if bright light on face.U can't use phone while being charged. Screen will be stuck as soon as u start typing or when u open a second app.Charging takes 2hours minimum from 20% remaining state. Its type C port takes even longer if I use other Qualcomm 3 chargers. The charger that comes in box doesn't charge other devices.Front camera is a disaster, even a 8k mobile will take better selfies than this.Rear camera is okayish.

Not Worthy! Disappointed!

Update after 8 months: -This is the worst phone I have ever seen. See the screenshot. This phone has stopped charging itself and saying that My phone is too cold and charging will continue when it is hot.I have kept my phone on charge for many hours and its too hot now, but still phone says my phone is cold.Update after 6 months use - I was correct. This is the worst phone ever and that too in so much cost. I am feeling like I have wasted my money in something worth 10,000/-Old Review - I am feeling bad to buy this phone. Camera and fingerprint sensor is so so bad.Whoever have used any Pixel phone or iphone will surely think to return this phone.I am still keeping this only because of S-pen.

Cheater Seller | Worst biometircs on a smartphone

I have purchased a Samsung galaxy note 10 lite mobile by using a hugediscount on it. But the display has purple dots even after 2 days fromthe purchase date 07/02/2021, I have thought that this is due to s penbut then gone automatically. Today Morning, I have again seen a dot atthe bottom side and spreading enormously to the whole screen. within twohour these dots spread to the whole display. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTING, Ihave to face this problem even mobile was not used for a single month.When contacted to service center they told me that this happens due topressure/force application on the screen. but nothing was happened assuch on my mobile. A faulty product was delivered to me. there are manyother issues with this phone like while using the camera slow-motionfeature there are continuous lines coming in the screen in lighting/heating issues etc. I have spent 32k on it. and such a faulty display/mobile was given by Samsung. need better assistance from your side

Do not buy this phone. I saw some reviews regarding it's finger print sensor, I thought there would be a minor glitch but when I used it, it really sucks. Finger print sensor doesn't work. I was fed up and removed it and started using the pin to unlock my phone. The phone is a typical samsung version which is very slow due to it's processor. Spen is fine you can use it but apart from that everything is horrible. Camera is ok not to good no to bad. But the phone lags. After spending 30k if you are getting this then please stop thinking about spen and go for some one plus phones like nord. It has much better display and refresh rate.Frankly speaking I sold out this phone after a week usage. Don't buy it guys that's the worst android phone I have ever used.

Do not buy this product frds if you value ur hardworked money. Reason , I went to claim Warranty after 11 days of purchase.1) Finger print is not working. Whatsapp & other impo apps locked with fingerprint. U can't use this facility in 43000.2) during charging phone temperature goes up 40°©3) Discharging easily4) MAIN MAIN REASON - Always shows Camera failed . Camera failed. We lost beautiful moments. U can't capture those.5) Samsung born quality..Hang ..Hang... Hang...Really trapped after 11 days. How will be ur mind if u claim warranty after 11 days. Better go for Redmi , oppo , vivo , iphone...i used all these. For 2 years each. Didn't feel anything. Samsung bad 👎 try to resale in Olx.

Worthless pen
","
I was continuously watching the reviews of this phone from the time it was launched. I decided to buy this phone on 1st may 21.I knew all the pros and cons of this mobile before buying this mobile. I would like to say that the phone is almost good. Ya, little bit fingerprint reader issue. I have to put my thumb atleast two to three times to unlock. The spen was the main reason to buy this mobile. Spen of this mobile is lacking gyroscope sensors thats why it can't perform air actions and one more thing that this spen works on capacitor so discharge very fast. Overall performance is good till now..I don't know what will happen further.The spen was the main attraction of this mobile and the spen itself is not a complete spen. Some features is missing.At the bottom right the spen is deviating(incorrect touch response) because of magnetic field of speaker. Bad magnetic insulation.So giving 2 stars.

I used that phone from last 10 days.let me tell you something more.1. Too much heavy ,this phone is even haviour than 4 year old one plus 5.Shame on you Samsung.2. This phone has 4500mah battery but if you dont get off always on,bixby & optimise its bettery by enable option. it will get down in 5 hours with normal usage.3 .even though it has fast charger,but it took 90 to100 min in full charging. With normal usage bettery drain fast even in facebook,twitter. my 4 yr old one plus 5 charged faster than it.In Short Samsung gives s- pen but skip all the latest features which are coming in 25-30k phone and we all expected them.please note that this phone don't get fast charge from another charger like  oppo/ one plus fast charger. even 10w charger show 2x time and other brand fast charger not get accepted.With my Normal usage [typical office goer]2-3 hours youtube,netflix1-2 hour social web sitesnormal camera usageno gamingthis phone will serve you 10-12 hours.Think again before investing money on Samsung .They are cheater.For positive points ,you can watch any youtube channel,they took money to sing all positives.

Has always been a Samsung user from the beginning. Never been this disappointed ever. Ordered the product just 2 months back. And has already got problems.*The front camera quality is really bad.*The back camera does does focus on objects multiple times when needed.*The phone has already started to hang while using when put for charging.*Been just 2 months and phone is getting heated up slightly now a days.Really disappointed to have paid Rs. 35,999/- on this product. Phone of half the prices are much better than this I feel.Don't go for this particular phone. If needed, try another faster much better phone at the same price or even lesser prices.

YOU HAVE BUILT A BEAUTIFUL HOME BUT THE TWO LOCKS DOESN'T WORK WELL OFTEN. HOW DO YOU FEEL??1. Samsung mobiles come with a black Samsung labelled seal. The seller has put a generic white seal which reads ""Do not accept if seal is broken"". But the original Samsung seal was already tampered by seller. I have raised a complaint with Amazon about the seller, but they just asked me to return.2. This phone has the worst biometrics on earth. It doesn't recognise my face quite often and the fingerprint scanner is very slow which makes you to go to PIN or Pattern. I have used Sony Xperia Z5 and XZ1 Compact before buying this and the fingerprint scanner was just quick.3. The proximity sensor is so dumb that it doesn't detect when I pick the phone.

hey amazon when price is 41999 why you sold it at 43999rs??  i loss 2k it's not right.and the phone is avarageProsser is old but it's not that bad i am OnePlus 6 and note 10 lite performance little better than 845 mainly when playing pubg.rear camera is good not the best but good enough.front camera is to much soft and loose complete details in low light, then plastic back is not look that bad as YouTube reviews shows and i feel it's safe have 0 breaking chance.  and the main big issue unlock the phone with finger print and face both are just worst..at the price of 43999rs (what i paid) even a 15 rs ph have better in display fingerprint sensor and face unlock.we cannot expect it from samsung type of brand Samsung evry time given the worst thing to there customer if they have to sell something at low cost..evry samsung phone ander 60k is just worst about this specs..samsung you need to improve don't do marketing with by only brand value. give us value for money products.

Bought this phone after lot of hesitations ,because lot of negative reviews about finger print scanner,and camera quality,but i bought this last week.as sais by many reviews it had fingerprint scanner issues and about front camera quality,it was worst than basic 15000 k mobiles..but rear camera was AWESOME.but got an update ,after that FP scanner got improved well but had some glitches at times,annoyed a lot and front camera quality also got an improvemnta BIT only..but i was satisfied with wat i had received and decided to move on with the same quality,but after 4 days of uasge,4G network was not getting connected (only 2 G)did  tried all lot of stuffs to crct ,not resolved.finally went to service center,as usual problem was not resolved and ROUTINE mother board problem was diagnosed.THEY did offered me replacement at once based on brand warrenty.but i refused and retuned the product to amazon itself.am first tym user of S PEN ,it was FANTASTIC and feature backed.ONE UI is also SUPERB UI skin,than OXYGEN OS(personal exp).so ,compromise for front camera(above avg quality,only low light photography was bad,FP scanner gave a mixed feeling) and buy at ur own preferneces.IF THAT NETWORK ISSUES WASNT THR,SURE I WOULDNT HAVE RETURNED IT

Camera (They are saying it has gotten better in One UI 2.5, waiting for it)2. Battery (They said, the battery will adapt to usage. It's been only 3 days)3. Fingerprint scanner (I registered the same thumb thrice and yet couldn't improve time. Maybe they can fix it with a software update)Why buy it? Simple; for an affordable S-Pen experience. Otherwise, go for S10 lite. Much better camera and battery.Btw, this is my first non-flagship buy so I may have kept my hopes just a teensy bit high.

only for stylus and camera

As all other reviews mention, the fingerprint reader and face unlock suck. They are super slow and don't even detect them most of the time. I tried the workaround with adding multiple copies of my fingerprint but it's still annoying. However the Knox UI and multitasking is really good and the S pen is really fun to use so if biometrics is not a problem for you it's a great phone.

Phone is good, battery is very poor. cannot even  last a day with full charge. no gaming at all and multimedia usage is also very less  then too it cannot last a day. S Pen is fair. But at times it does not detects the screen.Rest display  is good. Features are okay. Selfie camera is also poor. Finger print is slow unusually.

S pen makes it stand out

Review after 3 months usage.Display is brilliant,Battery is Good,Performance is Good,Premium look.S-Pen Works Fine.If you are looking for Camera,Don't buy this mobile.Camera Performance is not perfect at this price.Very poor camera comparing other in this same segment.This mobile camera performance is not meets our expectation.Not as much as performance, what they are mention in camera spec.

Good phone with some minor flaws.

- 8GB RAM  it runs fast- Back camera is really good- Battery backup is also good but you are a person who spends maximum time in your phone , opinion may vary.- S pen features are really good. If you are into making notes or drawings  you will love it- I didnt like the front camera because it gives an automatic glow  , i dont know whether there is a way to deactivate it but it is annoying- The on screen fingerprint scanner doesnt work most of the time that is one drawback which i have to highlight.- It does charge fast , takes  1 hour for full charging but reaches 60% in 20 minutes , the fast charging is not as good as the one plus 6 fast charging but better battery back than one plus 6.

Overall a good product.

Am not gonna talk about pros n cons abt this phones... but what I really loved about this phone apart from the obvious S  PEN is the phone's CAMERA.. its one of the best camera tat I have used in a very long time.. the clarity the color saturation ...its just amazing.. what I really didn't like is the finger print sensor.. its not upto the mark.. it doesn't read properly. Need a minimum of 2 tries. Annoying sometimes. The next thing tat I noticed is tat the network signals, it drops a lot.The battery back is pretty decent for an average user like me who uses it for business and for takin pictures.. and the SPen as usual its just amazing what all you could do with it its almost limitless.. I would strongly recommend Samsung Galaxy Note 10 lite.. An amazing Phone..

Good product.

This phones performs back camera super well but not that much on front cam. It gives extreme dull pics on low light condition but some times gives better on fully day light condition as compared to low light condition. And the processor preforms pretty well but some times it gives irritating responce. And some times any water drops on screen the screen will automatically run  up and down and closes and open the apps it very irritating even for a small drops also. And i just using it for S Pen experience the S Pen works amazingly. And the Battery life is also better than compared to other which is have the specifications. And the last one fingerprint sensor is worst that i ever been used my previous one's it opens a bit delay and it can't open for some times except these every thing is good.

Great performance, great battery!!!

finger print sensor doesnt work at all.. tried many timescamera is good, you can see in the picturebattery life is also fine till now.. its been a month with the phone. battery usually runs for a day. so its finemain purpose of buying it was the stylus i get along with it. it was the only option i had. though it makes my work easier but it could be better as on the applications i use .. like autodesk sketchbook it keeps changing a few settings that i dont like.also, google chrome hangs a lot on this phone dont know chrome is the problem or the phone is.all in all .. its little high pricedif you want stylus and a good camera then u may consider this phone.else its the usual.

When received the fone, box was damaged as shown. But fone was packed, seems that received a returned fone. Will look for few days n if any issue found will go for replacement.Now reviews,Pros,Awesome looksCamera that includes wide angle alsoS pen the great feature, can also b used as shoot button.Storage, alot of storage space use as much as you canVery fast charging, if you have less time and battery is low 5-10 mins charge will give you ample time to spend with your fone.Battery with normal use stays awhile, not tried with game yetConsA bit lag when disabling some appsOutdated processorVery disappointed with the video section, slowmo in normal light is very bad.Heat up a bit quicker than other fonesVideo recording requires a lot of light

Excellent smartphone for multitaskers :-)
","
Initially, fingerprint reader was very slow, but after a few updates, it has become good. So, no problem there. Camera is really good and it's best for someone who does manual photography with full fledged manual controls which you won't get in S10 lite. The main thing which makes this phone stabd out from others is S pen and it's great if you start using it for professional as well as personal wokr. This Exynos processor is not for someone who does a lot of gaming but in terms of multitasking I've faced no problems in the last 1-2 months. Battery works okay. I get around 7 hours screen time and charging time is approx.80 minutes. So, if you are looking for a non-Chinese phone this will be one of the best choices for you.

Really Suits me

Review after 20 days of use:Overall look of the phone is good. Red colour is a little darker than what your see in the image but still rich colour. S pen is a major plus point. You can do a lot of good things with it. Camera quality is excellent. Both front and back cameras give pretty good picture quality. Some in built Samsung apps are also very helpful. Battery life is average but will last one entire day with moderate use. Charging is very fast, so it compensates for average battery life. Fingerprint scanner is pathetic. It will read only 60% of the times. It did improve after a few days but still not upto the mark. Overall you get a nice note experience at a cheaper price. Lastly Amazon delivery boy was helpful.

Great phone with great features. Go for it 😊

The night shots by selfie camera are not upto the mark. The day shots are fabulous by every camera. Many have uploaded selfies which are not good to see, I have not faced any issues in proper lighting. S pen works brilliantly well. Fingerprint reader is a bit slow as compared to other devices of this price range but it works okay. Rear cameras are best in segment for photos as well as videos. The processor is 2 years old but doesn't feel so after 4 updates too.

It's a very good phone. The screen quality is very good, the battery is pretty decent, easily lasts a a full day, the performance is also very good, the camera quality is pretty good. The only issue is probably the in display finger print scanner - at times it doesn't work properly. But overall very happy with the purchase.

Best Flagship Level Smartphone.
","
I have been using it now for a month, i believe i can now sum up the features and performances. Cameras are great, but i prefer the shots without auto hdr which tends to over blow the colours. Battery is super fantastic with unnecessary features turned off. I would like to give it a full five star but... the fingerprint sensor is not too responsive compared to a stand alone sensor so registering my fingerprint was quite a task. Apart from that, it is all positive

Note experience at a budget
","
I love my new galaxy note10 lite. S pen features are available at an affordable price is the best thing about the phone. Phone as such is overall fast with very minimal hanging . Back camera is also excellent with good macro and micro picture quality though front camera is not up to the mark. Front camera gives low quality images in indoor lighting though it can be improved by using other camera apps. The feature I hate ,the only one ,in my phone is its finger print sensor which I'd often felt was such a joke. It'd failed to read my fingerprint in some crucial, emergency situations. If this could get fixed I would definitely tell this phone to be the best phone at the best price

Happy with the purchase. MUST BUY!!!!

Excellent smartphone for people who want to do multi task. The phone has very good UI which gives easy access for the applications. There are lot of fantastic things in the mobile......especially the pen function which makes it over the edge phone than other models. I will not get in the technical aspects as it's already there in the description of the mobile. Just make sure you configure fingerprint at time of set up, if you do it later it may not give desired results.This mobile is straight competition for lot of smartphone brands and best part is it's more economical and better than those.Go ahead and buy this phone......you will not regret on Ur decision.

Have u used Notelite10, if not, u r missing

Haven't had the addiction to use the Spen yet for daily use. But the screen and the battery life seems good.Especially the convenient Power mode can be used in the night time to extend the batter life.Overall it feels good to use a Samsung mobile again after trying other brands for 2 years. It gives me the pure flagship feeling and worth the money especially as I could avail the 5K Citibank discount offer too.The transparent cover with the device has a good grip. I preferred this free cover when compared to an after market cover than i purchased for around 400 INR in parallel to the device.

Good budget friendly phone for working professionals

It's a great phone overall. I have not faced any issues with battery. Yes the fingerprint is a bit slow but it's nothing compared to the phone itself. If you need an spen (which was my requirement as I have been using this series from Note 2), just go for it. They have a lot more features for the price rather than just the camera and battery. Also it has upgraded to Android 11 with One UI 3.1. O faced a bit heating issue only during these large upgrades. Very satisfied. Worth the price.

A grt phone by Samsung .Overall performance of the phone is grt no lag in daily use games also works  fine.Battery performance is good for normal usage it last for a day. And charge ups quickly.

Display is one of the best display i have ever used. The main key features of the phone is secured by knox security now a days it is very important comparing to other Chinese company phones. Rom is also good no blot wears works fine

Bought it for 28K with a heavy discount. You can trust on Samsung as well as Amazon BLINDLY for a worthy product. Front camera is amazing, rare cameras are amazing too. Super fast 25W charger charges it in 70 min from 0 to 100. Battery stays all day with a moderate usage including gamings, browsing and youtube streaming.

I got this phone for the stylus experience and headphone jack port.. the camera quality is really good. One UI is really good and Samsung has done a good work on it over its predecessor TouchWiz.. the signal, battery backup, speaker and fingerprint scanner is average.. but overall u get a good experience with knox security as your data is protected compared to other phones and also samsung pay service. Last but not the least the watching movies or playing videos is of different level due to the super amoled panel. Not found any lags till now after 1 month usage. Even playing pubg for one hr i didn't find any lags

This device is a great buy. It might seem a bit big, but its a great experience. The interface is very smooth and the shift from my old phone (Mi A3).The phone is bundled with many features and if you use all of them ( Always On Display,  live wallpaper, etc) you might have to charge it twice a day.The camera, fingerprint sensor, display, etc is really smooth and you will enjoy using it.Imp PRO - back cover and earphoneYeah yeah I know it isnt much of a pro for most people, but it was a sweet surprize for me!

Purchased on 24th Sep.Delivered on 27th Sep..Return window closes on 3rd OCT.ISSUE HAPPENED ON 10TH OCT.WE WERE DOING INSTAGRAM REEL, BATTERY WAS AT 15%. Kept the phone aside. In 10 min, there is no display on phone. Assuming low battery, we have connected for charging. After 1 hour also, no display on.Took it to service center. No damage identified on the outside. There is a signal link break between display and motherboard. I guess it is the wire bus.It does not come under warranty it seems. They claim that it must have happened because of phone fall on the backside. Boss ! ThERE is no FALL. No hint of damage on the external, buy I side online broke-- and no warranty!!! Shame on samsung!!!I got this Phoenix for 11,000 INR and now for replacing a broken wire, they are asking 6000/Samsung wake up !!Amazon wakeup !!!

Of its kind.3 this phone is marketed as 6 gb ram but most of the phone memory is already approx 3 gb is occupied by pre-installed app which you can not remove. This is complete cheating with customer regarding storage.4.in whatsapp I am unable to select the more  photos. Its processor is very slow.even slower than  my previous phone .Do not waste the money on the premium phone like these.Better go for any other company

BAD EXPERIENCEI would write not about product but my horrible experience,so that someone gets alarmed before u buy electronic items.High value items like this are non returnable. I didnt know the rule change. Accidentally my son ordered for my wife ,and just after i received the packet i thought to get a higher version phone. Didn't open the pack, hoping to return or get it replaced for another model.But to my horror, i found that Amazon has cleverly removed the return option. So I tried for a replacement, but i saw it can be replaced with same model. So even if,i didnt open the pack,i was forced to use it. It's a great lesson learnt.

My mail to Samsung CEO will clear up the issue I am facing with samsung. I have also attached images.Hi,This is Rahul Godara, owner of a Samsung Galaxy M30. My phone was showing an issue with moisture in USB port which seemed to be just a software glitch and after waiting for a whole day the phone was not charging with the standard samsung charger but the same charger is working with other Xiaomi Remi Note 7. I called the Samsung customer care. They gave me resolution of either updating the device or take it to the Samsung service centre nearby, which unfortunately was TVS electronics in Dwarka ,Ramphal chowk ,sector-7, New Delhi. As I was not able to take the device with me to the centre my mom went there with the device. It was until now that we did not have an issue with a small scratch on the screen (just below the front camera on the bezel but not on the screen or camera) which was promoted in status by the customer care staff to a “crack” in screen. Any way the device did not have any issues with the screen it was just supposed to be charged and may be updated as suggested by the customer care person. The device was bought on 22nd May 2019 i.e. approximately 1 month before this incident. So, we hoped that we would not have to pay anything as we where there for a software issue. The customer care representative came in with the report that it is a crack in the screen and they cannot fix the screen until they get screen fixed for Rs. 6000 /- then only they will fix any other issues which were covered in the warranty. Once again I had no issues with the screen. They were adamant about the scratch being the crack on the screen and asked to either pay and get the phone fixed or they cannot help us.I called the consumer court help line and registered a complaint ( Docket no. 1413754).I received a call from samsung and have been receiving calls for almost one week. I have sent clear pictures of the scratch and have been very patient with he process being followed. But my patience have been wearing thin as the Samsung executive only calls if there is an update done by me to the consumer helping complaint and asking me to wait and never provides a resolution.Is this the type of service samsung is imparting to its customers these days? I was a user of samsung phone ( galaxy note one ) and was very happy with it. The service and everything but had to leave because of similar issues in the past and now we are here again facing similar issues and with a realisation of making the same mistake again hoping samsung doing something better.I had already submitted details of the device to  the samsung executive by the Dilasini Chaudhary in emails with subjects “Reagrding Samsung Device_3730657670” and “Sending more pictures of the scratch”.The details of the device have been updated on the consumer complaint docket no. 1413754.SM-M305F/DSIMEI:xxxxxx/10/xxxxxx/4IMEI:xxxxxxx/10/xxxxxx1/2S/N: xxxxxxxxxxxxWarm regards,LATEST UPDATE: As soon as I sent the mail to Samsung CEO, I received a call from the person who has been delaying my issue. with the report that it is mishandling and we cannot resolve it. we have to sent it forward to management. from 28th of July today is 6th of July and the samsung M#) is lying on the desk just as a useless brick.SO.... Don't Buy. Customer support should be priority even if you are a big company with phone banging(literal explosions case of galaxy note 7) everywhere.

Good looking fone nice display asusual from Samsung I loved Samsung phone but now since they start using there exynos processors in there fones there phones have become a crap..till note 2 everything was fine..but after note 2 I bought  j7 2016 it had network issues  then finally I sold it for peanuts..then I didn't buy Samsung for a year I used other brands and was happy with there performance..but as I said I always  liked Samsung Mobile..so I thought to give one more try to newly launched Samsung m30 I bought it on first day sale..but to shock me it had same networks  issues as I had with j7 2016..very slow internet like 2G speed ..so I was sure its again same exynos processor problem..so called the Amazon cor the same they said technician ll visit to check the phone and technician said the same this phone had hardware problems. It's just I know coz of exynos processor..now they are going to replace it with new one but I have no trust that even second replaced phone ll be working well...as it ll have same issue coz of exynos  processor what to do can't get refund..so only can think of I ll have better luck with replaced samsm30..pray for me..speaker quality is cranky worst than an ordinary mobile fone microphone quality is also very poor to the surprise no headphones in the box.. I must admit  display is awesome...

Worst service by amazon. Please go for Flipkart

Hi,I purchased Samsung Mobile M30 from Amazon on april-2019. Since then i didn't mishandled or any impact on phone even no direct contact to any type of liquid or water . On oct-2020 , i found small purple spot on its left hand side on bottom and then its increasing as time passes  and its appeared dark purple and bluish in color . Hence today i visited to your service centre to show the display and issue  with mobile. After physical inspection of device the service centre guy said that its having liquid inside due to which this problem arose. So they said its chargable becaus eits not come under warranty . So i denied to do repair and take the phone back because i am not satisfied with service centre solution . I didnt do any wrong thing with device and only one year we used the device and problem arise .  no any physical contact of any loquid or water to mobile then how it was happened i dont know . It may be a device fault but Service centre guy not agree with my comments . It may be happened due to moisture i dont know its not our fault then why i have to pay ? Its really frustration to me so please request you  to take appropriate decision and provide the replacement for device or free of cost repair . We all going through a tough situation and i put my hard saving to buy this product and again i have to pay 4 to 5K its not justice to  us .Finally i check all the information regarding Samsung product and service delivery over internet and i found that  most of devices having such issues and lot of complaints placed by consumer against same issue .Within a year such problem arises in Samsung device its really bad to its reputation.Mainly this issue happened in A50 an M30S , ME and J7 samsung products so please check with your technical team what is technical issue with product .

An overrated underperforming phone.

Quality of Camera was the claim of the company for this model. However, Camera of the cell phone all of a sudden stopped working after two years. Tried to repair through Samsung service centre. But no use other than paying money to the repair centre. Had to buy another mobile as without camera not even UPI payments are not possible.  Wasted money for this model.

Average Phone with a high price tag.

It went offf with three months of usage now its not working. Worst phone. How to service. I took the phone  to  service centre and they told me mother board issue and got repaired it in warranty and they agreed every m series phone is designed in same way so it gets failed repeatedly without any problem from end user it goes off automatically and so plz take the extended warranty worth 1200rs and i took it. Again in a month again the phone went off the same way with flashy image and cracks on internal side of display and this time they took 4230 rs for repair claiming it internal cracks due to physical damage ( this time also i.ve done nothing like it hasn't fallen down from my hands and even no external force applied by me on phone..) still i paid a lot of money till now. Again in the month of october exactly 6 months after my phone purchase the same issue internal cracks of display and phone went off again they are asking me to pay 4230rs  as it wont cover this issue in warranty. When i asked for how many times should i pay to service agent of authorised service center they claim that we are no where concerned about this problem if you need phone you should pay otherwise buy a new phone. After so much of discussion they agreed this is a failed version so we are providing m30s series free screen replacement twice option this issue is happened because of manufacturing failure but we can't provide free service. If you need phone pay 4230 rs or go for consumer forum we are not concerned about it becauae every m series phones are designed in the same way and we won't agree its our manufacturing problem because we don't want to pay customer back. They even agreed these m series phones are all failed pieces of galaxy s8, s9 and s10. We are just recycling them and selling for low cost so that user might use such high end phone for low amount and quality doesn't matter in such amount so people can't do anything. So consumers plz don't buy this m series and get trapped like me. This samsung is cheaters. Tc

M30 Cons should know before buying

I bought this mobile and it stopped working exactly after 1 yr completion and it's a motherboard issue. This complaint I found in most of M series phone either at local repair shop or samsung service center and cost of repair is more than hlf of mobile price. Samsung is total pathetic in after sale support for their such type of issue, as company should take ownership of such complaints when received in bulk. Atleast please dont buy M series phone. Total waste of money. One yr which also it worked bt it was not that amazing experience.

Think twice before buying samsung midrange mobiles if u r long term user

Unboxed the item and tried to play ringtone or any song to check Audio quality. External speaker is not working . Performed Soft reset and Hard reset both. Now the device become abnormal state during booting stage and  is rebooting automatically for more than 30 mins by showing ""SAMSUNG GALAXY M30"" nothing given over control to move forward...Hold power button on time to control above situation but no use. Is started working like as Un programmed ROBOT.Not at all expected from SAMSUNG.!!!!!!!!!!!!!Are you guys are checking\testing products properly before dispatching to the customers ?? (or) for flash sale sake running behind ???? thinking like Let first deliver and make money, later on will respond to the customers if they face any problem with the defective piece. .Irony is for this product especially, customer will not get an option to select replacement or refund option . You have to be dependent on customer care executive for any further support.You will not come to know the status immediately though executive raised a request for Replacement. It take some time to reflect in the system to update after going through several approvals process. I.e replacement / Refund is not hassle free process.

Once again Samsung?

I received a defective Samsung Galaxy M30 from Amazon. When I am trying to turn on , it boots to the logo then goes to the ""Samsung M30 powered by Android "" screen, then it stays there. I've tried to do a hard reset by holding down the power button and the volume up button and have done reboot and still gets hung on the ""SAMSUNG M30 "" logo. I contact customer services of amazon but they also failed and arranged a Technician visit. After 2 days, Technician agent verify the mobile and reported to Amazon about this problem. After that amazon send a replacement unit to my address. Amazon transport service agent come my address and say that after verification mobile will be replace. Agent trying to turn on the device to get IMEI no. How is this possible? Phone already dead/hung at samsung logo. Agent said that if he saw IMEI number on mobile screen, then replacement will done. I contact customer services about this matter but no solution. Replacement is rejected by amazon transport agent . I saw order details in my amazon app, it shows replacement unit rejected by customer 🙄. I surprised about the service provided by amazon. There is no connection between amazon customer support, Amazon Transport agent, amazon app but managed Amazon india😆😆. All unit are managed by amazon but there is no connection and understanding between them. I think for mobiles flipkart is best and services provided by them is also great. Please do not purchase mobile phones from Amazon. Services provided by amazon is really worst. For this reason 95% of new Mobile phone lunched on flipkart. When purchase mobile phones on Amazon, think twice.

Ok phone.. 9000 enough but not worth of 11999.. processor is 1.8 it frequently lagging..
","
It's been 2 weeks since I'm using the m30 4/64 phone. While on the outside the phone looks stunning and the display is ever glowing eye catching the phone is nothing but disappointing when it comes to performance. The face recognition is slow and below average at best but the fi gerprint sensor makes up for it. Due to the notch display and the huge screen you will end up touching the phone where you never meant to. The camera is decent with comparison to current standards.The processor is its biggest weakness. The phone is noticeably slow for medium yo heavy users. While the Ram is 4gb it doesn't reflect on the performance. Games like PUBG hang and move very slow with an infuriating lag. I stopped playing pubg since I got this phone. The battery capacity is huge. 5000mah. It will easily last you a day (18) hours but on the flip side it takes that much longer get for it to charge.The software is unreliable. The phone stopped taking network by the end of first week in use. I have already been to the service center twice.The screen sometimes goes blank when you're watching a video and turn the phone horizontally. The lock button is way too sensitive so you will end up accidentally locking and unlocking often. As far as image stabilization after zoom is concerned,iPhone 6 beats it even today and I'm saying this out of experience not on a speculative whim.In conclusion,while the phone is cheap for its specifications it does not match up to Samsung's brand name. There are much better phones out there with better performance at possibly a cheaper rate.

I wont recommend you, unless you are looking for a phone from samsung under 15k.

After using this phone for a week, here is what I can say:Pros:1. Display - FHD+, sAMOLED, with always-on display.2. RAM and ROM - 6GB and 128 GB, install all the apps you want.3. Dedicated SIM and Micro SD slots4. Rear Cameras - Triple cam setup with wide angle lens and f1.9 aperture lens for low light  situations.5. Ginormous battery - 5000 mAh. 'Nuff said.6. USB type C - Hassle free insertion of jack into port.7. Latest Android Security Patch February 01, 2019 out of the box.8. Simple and customizable UI - For the first time in years, I did not feel the need to install Nova launcher.9.  Freakin' Headphone Jack!Cons:1. Glossy Plastic Body is a Fingerprint Magnet. Gets Smudged within few minutes of use.2. That Unholy Notch! Turning the notch off shifts the entire notification bar downwards instead of blacking out the notch sides and keeping the notification icons at the same place, reducing the screen space in the process.3. Fast charging?? Not so fast I must say. Phones Supporting Qualcomm QC4.0 charge much faster.4. Exynos 7904. Although uses same 14nm FinFat process as the SD660 SoC, It is quite behind the Snapdragon chipset. The SD660 SoC has 4 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores, the Exynos has only 2 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores. Also the Adreno 512 GPU in the SD is leaps ahead the Exynos' Mali G71 GPU.5. Bluetooth 4.2 only. No BT 5.0.6. USB Type C runs only at USB 2.0 speeds. No support for USB 3.0/3.1.7. Front Camera Low light performance is not great.8. No stereo speakers. Only one bottom firing speaker is present and its not great.9. Network strength is low compared to my other phones, Often dropping me out of VoLTE and 4G.. Again this issue is with the Exynos 7904 SoC. Their modems are just not powerful enough.10. Heats up quite quickly during games.Conclusion:Go for any other mid range phone from any of the brands of BBK Electronics China (oppo, Vivo, or realme, and Yes, all of them including OnePlus are the same company), mi Note (whatever variant number they are on currently) or ASUS Max Pro series. Many of them use SD636/660 SoC, They are better Value for Money than anything Samsung puts out in Indian Market. I'd also say that not including an earphone in the box is a con, but then, others are doing the same thing.

High Noise and heating problem
","
I have many complaints1) It's (m30)marketed as exynos 7904 processor but , I got a unit with exynos 7885 processor . This is main cheating .2)There is no light sensor , (I know front camera act as light sensor) but it's speed is pathetic I have adjust brightness every time . Shame for device of 15000 Rs cost .3)Even after taking calls screen will not lit up automatically I have to manually do it(because of lack of light sensor and poor quality of proximity sensor ).4) Speaker volume is not good (compare to old Samsung feature phones) and sound cracks more often . Head phone volume is low and it's not having good quality like old Samsung phones .5)Ultra wide angle camera quality is waste it's 5mp wide angle so no details in pictures at all .6) No native support for using amoled screen as led notification light . Have to use NoLED third party app.7) 13MP main camera fully waste . Pictures taken have short range clarity but doesn't have details of distance objects (remember my old Motorola g4 get more detailed distance shots). I think camera module is not up to the mark (cost cutting ???)8) status bar fonts are very small and no option to add extra icons like internet speed etc , there is no option in setting to increase status bar font .9) data toggle buttons ( between to two Sims ) is not available in notification bar.10) Samsung Galaxy apps always runs in background and collecting your information ,  no option for galaxy apps to stop in background and apply battery optimization. Often ""install galaxy apps "" ad pops up very annoying .11) Even phone colour theme cannot be changed unless you  buy Samsung Galaxy themes12) Exynos processor means to no custom ROM development.13)Fragile screen with no screen protection (dragon tail is there but no good).14) fast charger is total waste , you can't get much charge in short time so no 5 min charge and talk 2 hours like feature .15)  No otg support for laptop hard disc with external case ( even some old phones support other for hard disc).16)No correct size external cases and tempered glass support .

Bad Quality Phone

Iam writing the review after usage of 6 months. Initially it looks and performs very well. I started observing issues after 2-3 months of usage. Sometimes I got irritated with fingerprint sensor as it won't work.performance also sucks. Device with 6GB of Ram and powerful processor sucks to load a single application. It stuck very frequently. After restart of phone we can see abnormal behaviour of device. It won't allow to enter password sometimes.only good thing is better battery life and display.Edit : after 1+ years of usageUp to one year the mobile is pretty good with minor issues. Best thing I liked is battery backup.After 1.2 years suddenly someday I observed mobile is not getting g charged with the original charger given by samsung. Initially I though charger might not be working but same charger working with other devices. I tried with other fast chargers but no luck.I am in assumption that charging slot might be damaged but I can see it's getting charged with non fast charge support chargers and cable charging with laptop.its so irritating takes 10-12 hours to dull charge. I searched in Google and did all recovery planes no output.There are tons of samsung users are facing the same issue. Yet no replay/software update from samsung. Finally I decided to throw the mobile in dust bin and buy new one.If I r short time user *max 1.5 years) go aheadElse think twice before buying samsung mobile at MID range

Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint if stretching your budget a bit for Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50
","
I'm sharing some of the issues I faced with this phone and some good things too, which might be useful for other users to decide whether they should buy it or not.*Hardware:1. Fully Plastic body feels cheap2. Fingerprint works 3 out of 5 times and is remarkably slow (without vibration motor, so you wouldn't know whether it unlocked or not without looking into screen)3. Super-Amoled display is amazing4. Speaker is avarage5. Screen has no protection (easily gets scratches)6. Battery backup is superb (depends on your uses)7. Camera is strictly avarage8. Processor is just good (expected better)9. Charging takes almost 2.5 hr to bring it from 0% to 100% (still called fast charging?)10. Network reception is very poor (you get very low internet speed)*Software:1. It takes approx 30-40 seconds to turn the phone on2. No good themes or wallpapers are free, you need to buy them 😷. See the screenshots I have attached (MiUi is far better)3. You can't take screenshots or turn the screen off from notification panel (options aren't present, use hardware keys or activate assistant menu)Also, you can't take long screenshots or edit them directly after taking (no doodling option is present in gallery app)Verdict: A lot of phones are present in market with far better specs. Buy it only if you're a die hard fan of Samsung.

Decent smartphone in the price range.

i am going to give critical review.Pros1. Samoled display. Amazing. 20 % more attractive than ipc displays2. Battery is good. With 50 percent u can use for 7 hrs with watching 2movies in the gap3. Front cam is nice. Rear cam is poor. Not  worth4. Dolby atmos... though not really the case coz compared this to s9 of my friend.. s9 sounded real dolby not m30 that too can switched on when u put earphones on.. nonetheless volume will be bit louder if u turn it onCons1.  Frequently it lags. Experienced that trouble in chrome. So 1.8ghz lrocessor not enough go for 2.3 processor.2. User interface is not that good.3. Too many inbuilt samsung apps and google apps. Also no INBUILT APP LOCK this becomes a trouble when u want to install applock app.. if some one uninstall ur app then no security..  only inbuilt app can provide this facility3. MOVING FILES FROM INT MEM TO SD CARD IT TAKING TOO MUCH TIME.  Irritates me4. No vibration sensor. Also if u lock the phone and try fingerprint it should stay on display but it wont show display if u put wrong finger.5. Earphones should have been given. Conclusion  Not worth for 11999 but worth for 9000 only.. processor matters lot. So go for m30s... or like vivo z1 pro..

New generation phone at affordable price

Pros:1. Display quite smooth and pleasing.2. Don't think about polycarbonate body, build is good.3. Batery backup as compare to 5k is ok.Corns:1. Don't get puzzled by youtube review, camera is just ok as it include AI, pixel is not clear but for social media it will do the job.2. Design i think samsung followed the trend and other brand. My first notch display phone, thought it's gonna be ok, but trust me it looks really odd.3. Speaker sound quality not good, not a bit loud, just a cheap sound like low budget phone.4. Main thing where it comes to PUBG? You wont enjoy the gaming with the frame drop in balanced mode with medium frame rate. Lag is effective , lol the design is poor they have kept the speakar gaap in the bottom side so u will face interruption while gaming, the grip won't go easy as it have headphone jack also in the bottom- left. Which will definitely make u feel odd while gaming in loudspeaker or headphone. Even after 7days of use it has started to lag in basic/normal graphics with medium fram rate.I am a Samsung lover, where as i won't recommend you to waste money on this brand. They don't deserve the frame anymore.Only thing i have now is regret after purchase M30.

It's good but I HATE IT

I thought, Samsung is back with good phones and hence I tried it once again. Samsung is bad choice forever for me. I decided, will never buy Samsung phones in future.I received phone and noticed two major issues with this phone1. It heats up a lot when I travel. Of course, in AC room it will not heated up.2. Noise. So there is no voice clarityI booked return request then I came to know that this phone will not be returned but will be replaced. They inspected this phone and declared that it isn't  any fault in this phoneThey send a so called technical expert at my home. He told me that due to notch, there is not much space to adjust the speaker and mic hence in this model, you will find same voice or noise. For him, it is normal.Regarding heating issue, he told me that upto 46degree you can use it and it will be automatically switched off when it will reach up to 46degree. This phone heated up to 41 to 43 degree after few hours of normal internet use.I used to have Redmi note 3S. It was better than this mobile.I am suffering with this mobile without any help and support from Amazon and Samsung

Not upto Samsung Brand value

I made a mistake buying this mobile. So many told me not to buy Samsung mobile for its slowness and network issues, still I went ahead and bought it thinking by now Samsung quality would have bettered but nope. So many issues! First the mobile box had tampered, it looked like very old stock with dirty box. Then the box had only mobile and charger not even screen guard applied. Mobiles back is so plasticky and such a ugly looking! Only the amoled display is worth looking at. Finger print reader is so bad and slow, it takes a while to unlock or react. You doubt whether you properly kept the finger or not.Is been 10 days and phone is ashtray slow. Screen gets hung when some app is open and you get a call. Also, it gets hung when you get a call and try to silence it by pressing start button. Sometimes you feel even touch isn't working but it's because the app reaction is slow in this mobile.Good things I liked are amoled display, dark mode, customizations and some actions given to finger print reader like pulling down navigation bar.

The Note 7 Pro leads in several key aspects.If you are not much into high-end gaming, would value display quality over the camera performance, and are restricted by a budget, the Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint.

If you are thinking about a good budget device then, Go For It.I've used this device for 7 months, in order to know about it current opinion, scroll down.Pros:-1. 5000 MAh Battery capacity!!2. Triple rear Camera.3. 16 MP front camera.4. Full Screen (Notch) Display.5. Super Amoled Display (gives the best colours possible)6. Affordable!Cons:-1. It has Exynos processor for some reasons so you won't get to play very high graphics games very smoothly like you used to with sanpdragon...2. Dosenot have a Metal Body which would have made it more scratch resistant...3. I've heard that its face lock feature isn't that good but I haven't faces any issues with it so far...Edit 1: After using it for a month, mobile suddenly was unable to charge, had to replace the charging port. And you will get a lot of scratches so, a cover is highly recommended!Edit 2: Was Working Good for first 6 months but now, there are quiet a lot of issues like1. Can't use Internet through WiFi.2. Unresponsive incoming call interface.3. Fingerprint sensor barely works.4. Heating problem while charging.5. Weak processor, hence device struggles a lot getting some tasks done.6. Service Center cannot help me with any of these issues... 😐So, here's my final conclusion. If you are laughing to use it for only 5-6 months, it's a biut deal. This device is not for a long run.

Good Camera and Display, Processor not so much

Awasome phone with awasome specification, but i personaly feels phone's big screen sometime difficult to use.Detail review and why I gave 3 start reasons are as follow:Cons first:1. It started heating after 2 months of use that too I am not using it very roughly. In total 24 hours of day i am using it not more than 2 hours (including everything).2. Battery start draining fast compare to initial days. During initial days with the same usage it is used to last for two and half days but now it is lasting not more than one and half day.3. Started hanging up (stopped working). Specially while using camera.4. Camera quality is not as per expectation. Front cemera is okay but rear cemeras not able to capture things in detail. If you click a photo with rear camera and zoom it, the image will start tearing and blurring. Not very effective for students those who are rely on photos for their studies. Its personal experience.5. Fingerprint sensor is little bit slow. It takes 1 or 1.5 seconds to respond.Pros:1. Good and stylish looking phone.2. Adaptive display feature is awasome. No need to change the brightness setting while moving from dark to under sun light or vice versa, it adjust automatically.3. Good torch with adjustable brightness.4. Good sound clearity.I wish most of the cons will be eliminated with software update.And i wish this review will be helpful to the needed one.

A few months after I bought it, the camera stopped working, went to the service centre, they did smthg and sent me back home saying  ""it's good now"" even when I told them to do more thorough checks. Well, I was right and had to go back a couple of days again and had to leave it there because the camera software was apparently damaged ir smthg. After two years  now it's the same problem. It's a good phone, even the camera quality is good. The speakers are ok. But this thing is literally making me want to break it

I'm just a normal user i don't play games or use lot of apps so my reviews will be most likely on what i felt not great. I purchased this Mobile on March 2019.1.

Don't regret buying this phone one bit

Average phone... you're better off with an Asus or a moto.. the UI is very inconvenient.. takes a lot of getting used to.. even then using the phone is an annoyance rather than second nature.The screen is super bright so that's a plus . And the battery backup is very very good... if it was a more sturdy build would have served a better purpose as a work phone coz you don't have to ask anyone for a damn charger.That stupid pin with which you take the sim slot out should be banned for all phones. Could have had some other mechanism or at least give me a place to keep it..The colour reproduction is okay... seems a bit washed out.Random bugs and lags especially during basic functions like calls... very very annoying.Finally the biggest drawback... the touch accuracy is down the drain... I have to touch min 5 times to pause a damn video... it's a nightmare if I want to skip ahead.So if you need a phone maybe just to call and basic WhatsApp then this is the guy .. doesn't look too shabby... performs alright.. battery is awesomeness.But if you want a little more out of your phone.. just go to the other 5000 mah battery ones.Only reason I got this phone was for the fast charging 5000 mah battery which I wasn't  getting anywhere else.

Received it today.firstly the screen and display is great but the polycarbonate body looks real cheap for this price range.Checked through the settings and apps.well you will not find any lag for now.I believe thats same for all smart phones at this range.Guys dont go for this phone if you are camera savvy, its not the right deal. Although its usp is triple rear camera but its not just that good enough.Wide angle is superb but colour correction and AI control is no atall upto the mark. Note 7 pro, samsung j30 will be ranked way above these model.Front camera is ok and take decent photos.there is a pro mode in camera but not much manual option to p;lay with other that iso and exposure control.Video mode has literally no features.just point and shoot.Atleast expected slowmo and time lapse is 15k budget phone.Battery is good and fast 15w charger was in the package.

A perfect phone at a practical price!

The plus point of this phone is the display, ultra wide camera and the battery life. If you're someone who takes a lot of photos, and consumes a lot of media on there device then this phone is for you.Pros:-sAMOLED Display-Ultra Wide Lens-Battery LifeCons-Slower Processor-Software (Samsung Experience 9.5 looks dated design wise)-Plastic BodyPersonally I haven't noticed much difference in using the AMOLED Display but this might change with time. One thing you might need to keep in mind (I found out about this a little too late) is the processor is closed source so third party ROMs development might not be there. They should have shipped it with Android P and the one UI which is more polished. If you want a phone for camera and media consumption then buy the M30, otherwise if you want a durable phone with better android experience and processor get the Moto One Power.EDIT: After a week of usage I do not find the camera upto the mark, Images lack sharpness and they look a grainy when zoomed in even a bit. This was a huge let down as I expected this phone to have a better camera.

Samsung M30 - a sleek monster
","
This age samsung phones are nothing, when it comes to feel and user experience. The time the phone was first unboxed, the touch felt hard,but worked without error. Everything else good, camera clearer and real like, clearer than redmi phones, amoled also was ok, definitely amoled, but not very bright and colorful display. The back of phone also was over heating,I called up customer service, they said install all updates, it might change . But even after that, overheating is showing in the processor side and full screen ,when one game starts. The touch problem could not be solved completely, as this was not a appreciable error ,but only weak response and hard touch. I never felt like playing any game with such a touch and poor power behind the handset. Tried all touch repair apps from play store, and reset the phone also, but this never comes to a new phone touch feel. Terrible experience!! Even many China phones do more justice to everything. Samsung phones are only a name sake top notch.

I've never invested more than 8k for the two  smartphones I've used. I'm also not a guy who repeatedly keeps changing phones. So when my previous phone started giving me minor issues, felt it was the right time to buy a new one and upon being suggested by my friend, choose the Samsung m30, 6Gb Ram, 128 Gb variant. It's almost been 3 months since I bought this phone. It's pretty much like all Samsung phones filled with a wide range of applications, user friendly UI etc coupled with few new features.Pros.1. Good camera- Front camera in particular is very good. Also the wide angle rear camera helps you to capture a wider picture.2. Battery- Never ever did I think a smartphone would give a 24hr battery backup. I extensively use my phone for social media apps, netflix, Amazon prime etc but the battery life the phone has got is amazing. You won't even need a powerbank. You also get a fast charger which takes roughly 90 min for one full charge.3. Lockscreen stories- This feature is something new I've come across but nonetheless, is pretty amazing. Helps you keep upto date with the current affairs stories you are interested in while the screen is locked.4. Dolby atmos- Gives you a much better sound experience when using a headset. It is also categorised for various age groups and type of usage such as music, movies etc.Cons.1. Fingerprint sensor - It has been an issue as it doesn't detect your fingerprints sometimes.2. Ringtone- Not sure whether the feature is same for all Samsung phones, but the ringtone automatically increases and decreases. From what I've read across the internet, I've come to know that it is a feature that works based on the surroundings you/the phone is in.All in all, the phone is a decent buy for the price. Suggested for people whose usage is a lot and don't want their battery to drain quickly.

Got this phone around a month ago. My earlier phone was moto g5s plus. I am a moderate user of phone who keeps on hanging with internet and all the required essential  apps, I also  play games at times.Now what good about m 30 for me is:1. Premium  software quality with no ads.2. Excellent display.3. Better performance  compared to my moto phone. This was where I surprised even though on papers this phone has not very powerful processors but still it gives it's best when comes to background  app management. I have not felt any heating issues or lag issues even after using heavy apps for hours!4. Good front camera.5. Excellent  battery  life . Comes around 2.5 days for me.Some cons:1. Even though primary camera is good. But does not give it's best in low light.2. Yes its software is premium with ad free but i was expecting Samsung UI 1 which is available  in A series.3. Speaker could have been amplified more.Overall a very practical  phone which gives u a premium  feel especially  due to its display.Many people compare this with redmi note 7 pro. I agree note 7 pro is a good phone which has better processor but you cannot feel the same premium experience as m 30 here is why:1. Just compare the both display!2. Check out note 7 apps filled with full ads.3. Even though they claim 48 mp it's not always! it it gives u in pro mode with no zoom option.4 microphone and headset audio of m 30 is better.5. Note 7 is a perfect phone for teen agers who is more intrested in gaming or heavy usage. M 30 is for professional  and moderate  users who are more intrested in quality for primary usage of phone.

Good phone but outdated.

Samsung M30 is an excellent value for money. At the price range, it offers competent configurations. I have been using it for over a month and here are my reviews:Over all performance: Satisfactory. Though I bought the 6GB variant, there is no comparable improvement in performance when compared to a 3 GB variant. That being said, I have not observed significant delay in boot time of apps and concurrent background apps continue from the last session rather than re-launching.Camera: I am slightly unhappy with the 13MP primary camera. With the other configurations being competitive, a 13 MP primary camera seems amateurish. The picture quality retains the standard and with ambient light, pictures are of good quality. The 16 MP front camera is impressive and captures good selfie images. The other features of wide angle lens of primary camera, subject focus of both front and rear camera are also impressive and lives up to the expectation.Battery: The 5000 mAh battery is quite a mammoth. Do not expect it to last 2 days though. The idea is that with a good screen use throughout the day, there will still be some juice left in the battery to last the night. This seems reasonable battery backup before charging it up again.Media: The display and video effects are quite good. The DolbyAtmos needs a special mention which gives a notch to the audio experience when an ear phone is plugged in.OS: I received Oxygen in the boxed set and was a big disappointed. But Samsung released Pie with One UI within a month and this elated my mood.Overall its a very good smart phone to use at this price point. It would have been a nice though to include a silicone back cover and a screen guard in the box.If brand is of importance to you, then Samsung M30 will be worthy choice for you to consider.

AN EXCELLENT OPTION -VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY

First, i don't play game.Second, my primary purpose of buying this phone is watching web series and movies through Amazon Prime Videos and doind daily  normal uses.In Highest quality there is a option to download videos through prime videos is 1.8Gb/hr but honestly it will download only lass than 1Gb data in highest quality. The best part is you can play Prime videos in whole screen like which is not able to play in Redmi Note 8, which is also a full hd display phone.In realme 3 pro the maximum download quality option available is 2.3 Gb/hr, so it download better quality videos as compared  to Samsung galaxy M30 or Redmi Note 8.If your purpose is not watching prime videos than go for Redmi 8, yes simply 8, which has the best battery backup i have ever experienced. Lasts for 2 day through intense use.You can't compare the video quality through youtube or a video in your sd card ( videos will look approximately same in all these phones) but when you will start watching online contents (Amazon prime videos,  Netflix  etc) then there will be a major difference between these phones.Samsung M30 Android 10 experience after updates is very smooth. You can uninstall majority of preinstalled apps like Google play music, movies, books etc which you can't do in Redme note 8 and Realme 3 pro. There will be many advertisements in the realme and redme in there pre installed apps which you can't uninstall or even disable,but not in Samsung M30.For daily uses 3gb ram and 32gb memory of m30 is more than enough i didn't experience any lag or hang,works smoothly.

This phone's quality and features r inexplicable bcoz u can't explain feelings, buy this today

I have been using this mobile for quite some time now and to give a gist I have to say that there are a few compromises made to give consumers some decent specs.Some good stuff,Battery life is amazing.It gives me 1.5 days of power and still there is some 15% mostly remaining. Only 30% is sufficient to drive your day with normal usage of emails, songs and 30 mins of YouTube.Charges fastLittle more than half an hour is sufficient for 45% charge.CameraYou can not underestimate m30 here, it can take some serious photographs, if you do the settings right.DisplayOnly one word, Wow!SafeOther manufacturers in this range are mostly Chinese and everyone is aware that china is known for data theft. I might be wrong on this but anyways I don't trust these brands anymore.3.5 mm Jack not at top.This is a very specific issue, for me this is good because if you have wired earphones, wire handling becomes very easy.Some bads,Fingerprint scannerIt is the slowest I have ever used, although you will get used to it.BodyI have never used this phone without a cover, ever though it has developed big scratches at it's back. They are noticable even from a distance, if I remove the cover.Wide angle lensIt is there for just name sake, it doesn't take good photographs.Overall if you have used your old phone for quite some time and are looking for a phone for next couple of years, I think this is an option worth considering.Please note that I am not a heavy user!

Samsung has really created a masterpiece. I have been using it for the last 10 days. I have used other Samsung phones but this one is something different. Here, I am listing the pros and cons of this mobile phone.Pros -1- The battery is great. 5000 mah battery give you more than a full day backup on moderate use. The power saving mode of Samsung is worth going for. Use it wisely and I guess the juice will not run out for 2 or more days. I have tried that recently while I was traveling.2- Display is awesome. It feels.3- Design is also great. I have the blue one and it looks beautiful. The navigation settings let you make the navigation buttons disappear and you experience a better screen.4- The fast charging works really fast.5- Camera is great. Both front and back. Especially in low light conditions. Flash is awesome. Zoom is also great.6- No Hybrid slot is what I seek in the phones these days. Thus, you are not limited by the storage issue if you are using the dual sim.7- Dual 4g is good. Now, I can use my BSNL 3g and at the same time, my Jio works fine.8- Face recognition and fingerprint unlocking are very fast.9- Touch sensitivity is very much.10- I got 200GB space on One Drive for two years free with this device.Cons -1- The wide angle lens needs some improvement. The picture quality is just OK. But as this is a new experience, I would not say its a major con.2- The placement of earphone is downwards so when you want to use your phone earphone and charger plugged in, it becomes a little difficult to operate.For now, this is my experience, I'll keep updating.

SAMSUNG Galaxy M30 is simply great Phone from SAMSUNG under Rs.15000/-

I have always been a Samsung user and am always appreciating Samsung for their amazing services.I was looking for a new device and I was very head bent on the Samsung M30 the day I saw it.I am using the 4 + 64GB version in blue and it works just so well!!I am very happy with my device and recommend it to everyone looking for something in the price range.The 50000 mAh battery is just so helpful and very rare in mobiles, with normal usage on Wifi I get upto 3 full days of battery backup!And also you can fully charge the phone with the fast charger from 0 to 100 in just 2-3 hrs!The features are just unlimited and the device feels actually premium to use.An added feature of Samsung is that the phone damage can be repaired almost anywhere you are and it won't even cost you much.Plus Samsung is both, durable and reliable, even with the 4GB RAM I can play games with a lot of clarity!The device also doesn't heat up!The screen is vivid and almost every setting can be customized very easily and effectively for every person.The Samsung in-built apps might seem like a burden, but if you turn off the notifications, they're really helpful in gaming and multitasking!I have never experienced any system error in this device, if I have got any, it is due to some error I made, for which I was helped by the Samsung online chat service step by step.Samsung phones also have many many in-built features like antivirus, automatic cache memory cleaner and device booster that improve the performance of the product.With smart view one can connect easily to almost any TV set for screen mirroring. And the camera quality is just so cool! I don't even need to search for wallpapers, I can easily just take out my phone, look for a scene I like and click!Whatever I say is less, this phone is a must buy!The best choice ever!!

I recently bought a Galaxy M30 phone and I am fully satisfied with it. Thanks to the 6GB RAM, there is no perceptible delay in processing any command. Then there is the 128 GB Memory, which is more than a match for the videos which one gets very frequently on WhatsApp groups. The 5000 aAh battery enables it to run for two days without charging. Thanks to the C type charging cable, it gets fully charged in about an hour (earlier, I had to charge my phone each night, but sometimes I ran out of juice by evening).Feature by feature, M30 is better than the J8 I was using earlier, but it cost me less than what I paid for J8 less than a year ago. M30 also compares quite well with the higher priced A50 which my nephew uses - the specifications are nearly identical, but the camera is superior in M30.This phone is described as ""Made for India"" and Samsung seems to have done away with all the frills in terms of packaging - in other words, the box is quite flimsy. Apart from the handset itself, all you get is a data cable, a travel adaptor and an ejection pin - there are no earphones which used to be a standard accessory in earlier models. However, no compromises have been made in the specifications and the manufacturing quality of the phone itself.On the whole, an excellent option for Samsung fans - the latest features and very good value for money too!

The device which I am using is Samsung Galaxy M30 which comes with 6gb RAM and 128gb of storage.Samsung Galaxy M30 is powered by a 1.8GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor that features 2 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and 6 cores clocked at 1.6GHz. It has Mali G71 gpu.Coming to the display it has 6.40-inch infinity U superAMOLED FullHD+ touchscreen and an aspect ratio of 19.5 : 9.The screen has very good viewing angles and looks very punchy.It has that auto brightness option too.Moving on to the camera it has a rear triple camera setup which is a very nice thing.We have 13 MP main camera @ f1.9 + 5MP Wide Angle camera + 5 MP Depth sensing camera.Moving to to the front camera it's a 16MP shooter.It's having a huge 5000 mAh battery which is a good thing for heavy users. We can easily get 10-12. Hrs of screentime in this device.Moving on to the charger it has USB type-C port which is actually a good thing. The charger is a fast charger that is 9 Volts at 1.6 ampere.Coming on to the device it has a polycarbonate back with gradiant colour i.e. at the top it is more bluish and becomes black at the bottom. It actually gives it a premium look and also at the back we have finger unlock sensor.In addition it has a dual SIM slot(both 4G) plus a dedicated micro SD slot also which is a nice thing as well.Its memory is expandable up to 512 gb.The phone has Android oreo 8.1 and Samsung Experience 9.5 UI.It's a good phone with good built quality and I like all the features especially the tripple camera setup. It has that wide angle lens which gives a different perspective and it is a good feature to have on a smartphone. The pictures come out to be good with good colours.The camera does a very good job in low light conditions also.It's a value for money kind of a device!

This Phone is above this world of android phones.""FINGERPRINT READER"" is as good as the eye power of detecting objects in 1/16th of a second.And when I say ""BATTERY LIFE"", you can talk more than 24 hours in single full charge. U can use internet as much as you can by charging once in a day. U can play games, listen to music (YouTube) , video calling and much more u can do. This phone has that much battery life, you will forget when was the last time you charged the phone.U always don't need to bring your charger with you, if you are on a one day outing.And it's FAST CHARGING"" is also amazing, the phone takes approx 40 minutes to full charge.Without using internet, I can guess, u can use the phone for minimum 3/4 days.And one more thing, ULTRA POWER SAVING MODE, after applying this mode u can use the phone for a complete day even in 10% charging and u can use 6-8 Apps in this mode, u can use internet too.And I thinking I don't need to review it's CAMERAS bcoz I have no words to praise the cameras, Such amazing high quality pictures with amazing filters of different colours , u can record videos in very high resolution.When we talk about SCREEN, it has very attractive and colourful screen, when u touch u can feel the smoothness. Pixels of the screen are very good, u can use YouTube upto 4K.And when we talk about RAM and INTERNAL STORAGE u have 4 GB Ram and 64 GB internal storage, you will NEVER face HANG problem.And it is just a overview, there is much much more in this phone, u will never regret buying this phone.I strongly recommend this phone to each and everyone. I'm using it since June , from that day I haven't faced any problem.

Don't buy any Samsung phone with exynos processor..

First of all I would like to inform you that I am writing this review after 2month of purchase of m30 black 4gb ram. This is the best in in mid range of 15k. Phone has got its update i.e. android 9 which is awesome. Phone has super battery performance.once fully charged phone can run up to 2 days in normal usage. Phone is awesome for gaming user but I will recommend them to got with 6gb ram variants. Talking with phone design the front panel is looking sexy,and as well as back.one issue with back panel is that it is very slippery you need to handle it properly if you didn't have back cover.coming with camera quality front 16 megapixel is awesome I can't imagine the picture quality in this range of phone only issue with front camera is low light issues.secondly if we talk about primary camera it's too good.triple camera with wide angle is awesome.even low light is not a big deal.i have posted some pictures for camera quality. Talking about fingerprints it is placed little above so in starting you will face some issues while using it but at later stage it will be okay for you. For charging they had provided type c charger which is very much cool. Full phone will get charged within less than 2hrs reason as battery is 5000 mah so it is taking some time but if you charging for 30 mins also it's enough for 5 to 6 hrs. Only think which I am disappointed is that they didn't provide earphone Talking about overall performance phone is awesome I had used it for 2months and personally I am very much satisfied with phone performance Samsung had done wonderful job in mid segment price range. I would also thank Amazon India which delivers the product within 1 day. If you desire any phone under 15k m30 is best which I will recommend.

Platform - Android 8.1 (Oreo), upgradable to Android 9.0 (Pie); One UI (My phone is upgraded after 20 days of purchase) and Exynos 7904 octa-core processor never lets the phone slow down.5. Memory - I use 4GB+64 GB device, I can assure no hanging or lagging problem even if you use it for continuous 1-2 hours with several apps running.6. Camera - Triple rear camera (13+5+5 MP) with 16 MP selfie camera is simply awesome.7. Sound - Dolby Atmos sound with active noise cancelation, functioning great.8. Sensors - Fingerprint sensor is rear mounted and believe me till date no issue with the sensor, working pretty smoothly.9. Battery - Li-Po 5000 mAh battery with Fast battery charging 15W, Full charge completes within 1.5 hours if you put charge at 15% battery remaining and trust my according my usage it stays for whole 2 days after normal usage of device.10. Miscellaneous - Wi-Fi 802.11, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS is there, FM Radio with recording, USB 2.0 Type-C with reversible connector and most important SAR of galaxy M30 is 0.41 W/kg (Low radiation)After using it for about 4 months it's all well and simply amazing.Thank you SAMSUNG and AMAZON for making my life awesome.- Nilendu Saha (Kolkata, West Bengal)

Poor quality Item

I bought this for my 2 daughter who had kidnapped my wife's AND my phone everyday and refuses to give it until we threaten them with the police/indian army/indian airforce etc.My married life was going to hell, my wife was irritated and frustrated, she was threatening with divorce. Everyday once we reach home our phones disappears and only appears once our daughters go to school in the morning. I had to check my mails in my laptop instead of my phone which is more convenient as well. Many days I leave office late so that I have my phone in my possession, and this was causing health problems for me.I was on a crucial turining point in my life.Then I saw this AD from Samsung. My life was about to change for ever.I placed order and it was delivered in the same day.And our life was reset. We were back to early days of our daughters who would happily ignore me and my wife's existence and just do thier own stuff without any troubles.Once we bought this phone, we are leading a happy life. Our phones no more disappears, I can leave my phone on a table or sofa and goto toilet and come back with the phone being in the excat same place where I had left it.It was bliss.And I can check my mails in my own phone instead of laptop. My wife has also started loving me again, she dropped the idea of divorcing me.We are only little happy family because of M30.Ah about the phone, its a excellent phone, just go ahead and buy it.

Worst phone gets display cracks automatically without falling down and when in hands

Pros:> Display is very cool. On par with flagship phones.> Battery life is great.> Camera quality is fair, comparing it with previous generation samsung phones.> Touch is very smooth. Much smoother than the competition redmi note 7 pro. And also a better display than the same.> fast charger is included in the box!> Widevine L1 certified, so you can watch shows and youtube videos in HD.> really good fast charging. Goes from 10 to 100 percent in 2 hours, and then lasts 2 days with moderate usage. Even a quick 10 minutes charge will help you keep your phone alive for the rest of your day.> triple camera setup with a wide angle lens for great landscape pictures.Cons> processor not powerful enough. Not a good choice for hardcore gamers. But you can play games on low quality.> night camera is okayish. Could have been better.> no 4k video, not even 60fps option in the videos, so there is no slowmo either.> Aspect ratio is a bit odd. Videos are slighty zoomed in on apps. Even instagram stories are slightly zoomed in to fit on screen. There must be a way to change it but I have yet to discover the setting.> No gorilla glass and polycarbonate back. Both sides are prone to scratches.But it if:You are a student and spend a lot of time on phone studying and taking notes.If you want to watch shows online and youtube in good quality.If you want a phone that lasts long (in terms of battery).Don't buy if you want a high-performance phone.Rating: 8/10. The phone is good for its price. You won't get this display at this price in any other phone. The battery and fast charging are a nice addition.

Worst ever

I bought the 6GB+128GB Black variant. First of all, for people who are complaining about unable to play PUBG, FOR GOD'S SAKE INCREASE YOUR BUDGET OR GO FOR OTHER BRANDs. This phone is for people who are looking for a better display, long battery life and Advertisement free OS (sick of Xiaomi).Battery- I get around 8+ hrs of screen ontime with 50% brightness. My phone is connected to Wifi 95% of the time with 2 4G connections running in the background. I have multiple BT devices which were operated through this phone. I have been torrenting, listening to music, watching videos in YT, Netflix, calling for 2+ hrs, texting, trying out new apps etc and still left with 15% battery. Although, fast charger of 15 W is orovided with the phone but I use a 18W MI charger. Now thats a battery😀Screen- Its super Amoled screen, therefore, the video quality is extremy good  The colors are correctly saturated with deep blacks making video watching a pleasant experience. It also comes with L1 Widevine support, so you can stream videos in HD. Overall, a very good display in this budget.OS- Not as good as stock android ( yes I prefer stock android) but comes with a lot of customization which increases the productivity. However, there are no irritating advertisements anywhere in the OS unlike Xiaomi phones.Operation- Smooth so far with good RAM management. I did not face any lag whike using multiple apps. But a few more updates to One UI will be good.Storage- You get 100+ GB free when you boot the phone for the first time and you get a dedicated SD card slot.Camera- I prefer DSLR for photos, however, for casual shots, its ok.

My mail to Samsung CEO will clear up the issue I am facing with samsung. I have also attached images.Hi,This is Rahul Godara, owner of a Samsung Galaxy M30. My phone was showing an issue with moisture in USB port which seemed to be just a software glitch and after waiting for a whole day the phone was not charging with the standard samsung charger but the same charger is working with other Xiaomi Remi Note 7. I called the Samsung customer care. They gave me resolution of either updating the device or take it to the Samsung service centre nearby, which unfortunately was TVS electronics in Dwarka ,Ramphal chowk ,sector-7, New Delhi. As I was not able to take the device with me to the centre my mom went there with the device. It was until now that we did not have an issue with a small scratch on the screen (just below the front camera on the bezel but not on the screen or camera) which was promoted in status by the customer care staff to a “crack” in screen. Any way the device did not have any issues with the screen it was just supposed to be charged and may be updated as suggested by the customer care person. The device was bought on 22nd May 2019 i.e. approximately 1 month before this incident. So, we hoped that we would not have to pay anything as we where there for a software issue. The customer care representative came in with the report that it is a crack in the screen and they cannot fix the screen until they get screen fixed for Rs. 6000 /- then only they will fix any other issues which were covered in the warranty. Once again I had no issues with the screen. They were adamant about the scratch being the crack on the screen and asked to either pay and get the phone fixed or they cannot help us.I called the consumer court help line and registered a complaint ( Docket no. 1413754).I received a call from samsung and have been receiving calls for almost one week. I have sent clear pictures of the scratch and have been very patient with he process being followed. But my patience have been wearing thin as the Samsung executive only calls if there is an update done by me to the consumer helping complaint and asking me to wait and never provides a resolution.Is this the type of service samsung is imparting to its customers these days? I was a user of samsung phone ( galaxy note one ) and was very happy with it. The service and everything but had to leave because of similar issues in the past and now we are here again facing similar issues and with a realisation of making the same mistake again hoping samsung doing something better.I had already submitted details of the device to  the samsung executive by the Dilasini Chaudhary in emails with subjects “Reagrding Samsung Device_3730657670” and “Sending more pictures of the scratch”.The details of the device have been updated on the consumer complaint docket no. 1413754.SM-M305F/DSIMEI:xxxxxx/10/xxxxxx/4IMEI:xxxxxxx/10/xxxxxx1/2S/N: xxxxxxxxxxxxWarm regards,LATEST UPDATE: As soon as I sent the mail to Samsung CEO, I received a call from the person who has been delaying my issue. with the report that it is mishandling and we cannot resolve it. we have to sent it forward to management. from 28th of July today is 6th of July and the samsung M#) is lying on the desk just as a useless brick.SO.... Don't Buy. Customer support should be priority even if you are a big company with phone banging(literal explosions case of galaxy note 7) everywhere.

Hi,I purchased Samsung Mobile M30 from Amazon on april-2019. Since then i didn't mishandled or any impact on phone even no direct contact to any type of liquid or water . On oct-2020 , i found small purple spot on its left hand side on bottom and then its increasing as time passes  and its appeared dark purple and bluish in color . Hence today i visited to your service centre to show the display and issue  with mobile. After physical inspection of device the service centre guy said that its having liquid inside due to which this problem arose. So they said its chargable becaus eits not come under warranty . So i denied to do repair and take the phone back because i am not satisfied with service centre solution . I didnt do any wrong thing with device and only one year we used the device and problem arise .  no any physical contact of any loquid or water to mobile then how it was happened i dont know . It may be a device fault but Service centre guy not agree with my comments . It may be happened due to moisture i dont know its not our fault then why i have to pay ? Its really frustration to me so please request you  to take appropriate decision and provide the replacement for device or free of cost repair .

An overrated underperforming phone.

Quality of Camera was the claim of the company for this model. However, Camera of the cell phone all of a sudden stopped working after two years. Tried to repair through Samsung service centre. But no use other than paying money to the repair centre. Had to buy another mobile as without camera not even UPI payments are not possible.  Wasted money for this model.

Average Phone with a high price tag.

It went offf with three months of usage now its not working. Worst phone. How to service. I took the phone  to  service centre and they told me mother board issue and got repaired it in warranty and they agreed every m series phone is designed in same way so it gets failed repeatedly without any problem from end user it goes off automatically and so plz take the extended warranty worth 1200rs and i took it. Again in a month again the phone went off the same way with flashy image and cracks on internal side of display and this time they took 4230 rs for repair claiming it internal cracks due to physical damage ( this time also i.ve done nothing like it hasn't fallen down from my hands and even no external force applied by me on phone..) still i paid a lot of money till now. Again in the month of october exactly 6 months after my phone purchase the same issue internal cracks of display and phone went off again they are asking me to pay 4230rs  as it wont cover this issue in warranty. When i asked for how many times should i pay to service agent of authorised service center they claim that we are no where concerned about this problem if you need phone you should pay otherwise buy a new phone. After so much of discussion they agreed this is a failed version so we are providing m30s series free screen replacement twice option this issue is happened because of manufacturing failure but we can't provide free service. If you need phone pay 4230 rs or go for consumer forum we are not concerned about it becauae every m series phones are designed in the same way and we won't agree its our manufacturing problem because we don't want to pay customer back. They even agreed these m series phones are all failed pieces of galaxy s8, s9 and s10. We are just recycling them and selling for low cost so that user might use such high end phone for low amount and quality doesn't matter in such amount so people can't do anything. So consumers plz don't buy this m series and get trapped like me. This samsung is cheaters. Tc

M30 Cons should know before buying

I bought this mobile and it stopped working exactly after 1 yr completion and it's a motherboard issue. This complaint I found in most of M series phone either at local repair shop or samsung service center and cost of repair is more than hlf of mobile price. Samsung is total pathetic in after sale support for their such type of issue, as company should take ownership of such complaints when received in bulk. Atleast please dont buy M series phone. Total waste of money. One yr which also it worked bt it was not that amazing experience.

Unboxed the item and tried to play ringtone or any song to check Audio quality. External speaker is not working . Performed Soft reset and Hard reset both. Now the device become abnormal state during booting stage and  is rebooting automatically for more than 30 mins by showing ""SAMSUNG GALAXY M30"" nothing given over control to move forward...Hold power button on time to control above situation but no use. Is started working like as Un programmed ROBOT.Not at all expected from SAMSUNG.!!!!!!!!!!!!!Are you guys are checking\testing products properly before dispatching to the customers ?? (or) for flash sale sake running behind ???? thinking like Let first deliver and make money, later on will respond to the customers if they face any problem with the defective piece. .Irony is for this product especially, customer will not get an option to select replacement or refund option . You have to be dependent on customer care executive for any further support.You will not come to know the status immediately though executive raised a request for Replacement. It take some time to reflect in the system to update after going through several approvals process. I.e replacement / Refund is not hassle free process.

Once again Samsung?

I received a defective Samsung Galaxy M30 from Amazon. When I am trying to turn on , it boots to the logo then goes to the ""Samsung M30 powered by Android "" screen, then it stays there. I've tried to do a hard reset by holding down the power button and the volume up button and have done reboot and still gets hung on the ""SAMSUNG M30 "" logo. I contact customer services of amazon but they also failed and arranged a Technician visit. After 2 days, Technician agent verify the mobile and reported to Amazon about this problem. After that amazon send a replacement unit to my address. Amazon transport service agent come my address and say that after verification mobile will be replace. Agent trying to turn on the device to get IMEI no. How is this possible? Phone already dead/hung at samsung logo. Agent said that if he saw IMEI number on mobile screen, then replacement will done. I contact customer services about this matter but no solution. Replacement is rejected by amazon transport agent . I saw order details in my amazon app, it shows replacement unit rejected by customer 🙄. I surprised about the service provided by amazon. There is no connection between amazon customer support, Amazon Transport agent, amazon app but managed Amazon india😆😆. All unit are managed by amazon but there is no connection and understanding between them. I think for mobiles flipkart is best and services provided by them is also great. Please do not purchase mobile phones from Amazon. Services provided by amazon is really worst. For this reason 95% of new Mobile phone lunched on flipkart. When purchase mobile phones on Amazon, think twice.

Ok phone.. 9000 enough but not worth of 11999.. processor is 1.8 it frequently lagging..
","
It's been 2 weeks since I'm using the m30 4/64 phone. While on the outside the phone looks stunning and the display is ever glowing eye catching the phone is nothing but disappointing when it comes to performance. The face recognition is slow and below average at best but the fi gerprint sensor makes up for it. Due to the notch display and the huge screen you will end up touching the phone where you never meant to. The camera is decent with comparison to current standards.The processor is its biggest weakness. The phone is noticeably slow for medium yo heavy users. While the Ram is 4gb it doesn't reflect on the performance. Games like PUBG hang and move very slow with an infuriating lag. I stopped playing pubg since I got this phone. The battery capacity is huge. 5000mah. It will easily last you a day (18) hours but on the flip side it takes that much longer get for it to charge.The software is unreliable. The phone stopped taking network by the end of first week in use. I have already been to the service center twice.The screen sometimes goes blank when you're watching a video and turn the phone horizontally. The lock button is way too sensitive so you will end up accidentally locking and unlocking often. As far as image stabilization after zoom is concerned,iPhone 6 beats it even today and I'm saying this out of experience not on a speculative whim.In conclusion,while the phone is cheap for its specifications it does not match up to Samsung's brand name. There are much better phones out there with better performance at possibly a cheaper rate.

I wont recommend you, unless you are looking for a phone from samsung under 15k.

After using this phone for a week, here is what I can say:Pros:1. Display - FHD+, sAMOLED, with always-on display.2. RAM and ROM - 6GB and 128 GB, install all the apps you want.3. Dedicated SIM and Micro SD slots4. Rear Cameras - Triple cam setup with wide angle lens and f1.9 aperture lens for low light  situations.5. Ginormous battery - 5000 mAh. 'Nuff said.6. USB type C - Hassle free insertion of jack into port.7. Latest Android Security Patch February 01, 2019 out of the box.8. Simple and customizable UI - For the first time in years, I did not feel the need to install Nova launcher.9.  Freakin' Headphone Jack!Cons:1. Glossy Plastic Body is a Fingerprint Magnet. Gets Smudged within few minutes of use.2. That Unholy Notch! Turning the notch off shifts the entire notification bar downwards instead of blacking out the notch sides and keeping the notification icons at the same place, reducing the screen space in the process.3. Fast charging?? Not so fast I must say. Phones Supporting Qualcomm QC4.0 charge much faster.4. Exynos 7904. Although uses same 14nm FinFat process as the SD660 SoC, It is quite behind the Snapdragon chipset. The SD660 SoC has 4 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores, the Exynos has only 2 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores. Also the Adreno 512 GPU in the SD is leaps ahead the Exynos' Mali G71 GPU.5. Bluetooth 4.2 only. No BT 5.0.6. USB Type C runs only at USB 2.0 speeds. No support for USB 3.0/3.1.7. Front Camera Low light performance is not great.8. No stereo speakers. Only one bottom firing speaker is present and its not great.9. Network strength is low compared to my other phones, Often dropping me out of VoLTE and 4G.. Again this issue is with the Exynos 7904 SoC. Their modems are just not powerful enough.10. Heats up quite quickly during games.Conclusion:Go for any other mid range phone from any of the brands of BBK Electronics China (oppo, Vivo, or realme, and Yes, all of them including OnePlus are the same company), mi Note (whatever variant number they are on currently) or ASUS Max Pro series. Many of them use SD636/660 SoC, They are better Value for Money than anything Samsung puts out in Indian Market. I'd also say that not including an earphone in the box is a con, but then, others are doing the same thing.

High Noise and heating problem
","
I have many complaints1) It's (m30)marketed as exynos 7904 processor but , I got a unit with exynos 7885 processor . This is main cheating .2)There is no light sensor , (I know front camera act as light sensor) but it's speed is pathetic I have adjust brightness every time . Shame for device of 15000 Rs cost .3)Even after taking calls screen will not lit up automatically I have to manually do it(because of lack of light sensor and poor quality of proximity sensor ).4) Speaker volume is not good (compare to old Samsung feature phones) and sound cracks more often . Head phone volume is low and it's not having good quality like old Samsung phones .5)Ultra wide angle camera quality is waste it's 5mp wide angle so no details in pictures at all .6) No native support for using amoled screen as led notification light . Have to use NoLED third party app.7) 13MP main camera fully waste . Pictures taken have short range clarity but doesn't have details of distance objects (remember my old Motorola g4 get more detailed distance shots). I think camera module is not up to the mark (cost cutting ???)8) status bar fonts are very small and no option to add extra icons like internet speed etc , there is no option in setting to increase status bar font .9) data toggle buttons ( between to two Sims ) is not available in notification bar.10) Samsung Galaxy apps always runs in background and collecting your information ,  no option for galaxy apps to stop in background and apply battery optimization. Often ""install galaxy apps "" ad pops up very annoying .11) Even phone colour theme cannot be changed unless you  buy Samsung Galaxy themes12) Exynos processor means to no custom ROM development.13)Fragile screen with no screen protection (dragon tail is there but no good).14) fast charger is total waste , you can't get much charge in short time so no 5 min charge and talk 2 hours like feature .15)  No otg support for laptop hard disc with external case ( even some old phones support other for hard disc).16)No correct size external cases and tempered glass support .

Bad Quality Phone

Iam writing the review after usage of 6 months. Initially it looks and performs very well. I started observing issues after 2-3 months of usage. Sometimes I got irritated with fingerprint sensor as it won't work.performance also sucks. Device with 6GB of Ram and powerful processor sucks to load a single application. It stuck very frequently. After restart of phone we can see abnormal behaviour of device. It won't allow to enter password sometimes.only good thing is better battery life and display.Edit : after 1+ years of usageUp to one year the mobile is pretty good with minor issues. Best thing I liked is battery backup.After 1.2 years suddenly someday I observed mobile is not getting g charged with the original charger given by samsung. Initially I though charger might not be working but same charger working with other devices. I tried with other fast chargers but no luck.I am in assumption that charging slot might be damaged but I can see it's getting charged with non fast charge support chargers and cable charging with laptop.its so irritating takes 10-12 hours to dull charge. I searched in Google and did all recovery planes no output.There are tons of samsung users are facing the same issue. Yet no replay/software update from samsung. Finally I decided to throw the mobile in dust bin and buy new one.If I r short time user *max 1.5 years) go aheadElse think twice before buying samsung mobile at MID range

Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint if stretching your budget a bit for Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50
","
I'm sharing some of the issues I faced with this phone and some good things too, which might be useful for other users to decide whether they should buy it or not.*Hardware:1. Fully Plastic body feels cheap2. Fingerprint works 3 out of 5 times and is remarkably slow (without vibration motor, so you wouldn't know whether it unlocked or not without looking into screen)3. Super-Amoled display is amazing4. Speaker is avarage5. Screen has no protection (easily gets scratches)6. Battery backup is superb (depends on your uses)7. Camera is strictly avarage8. Processor is just good (expected better)9. Charging takes almost 2.5 hr to bring it from 0% to 100% (still called fast charging?)10. Network reception is very poor (you get very low internet speed)*Software:1. It takes approx 30-40 seconds to turn the phone on2. No good themes or wallpapers are free, you need to buy them 😷. See the screenshots I have attached (MiUi is far better)3. You can't take screenshots or turn the screen off from notification panel (options aren't present, use hardware keys or activate assistant menu)Also, you can't take long screenshots or edit them directly after taking (no doodling option is present in gallery app)Verdict: A lot of phones are present in market with far better specs. Buy it only if you're a die hard fan of Samsung.

i am going to give critical review.Pros1. Samoled display. Amazing. 20 % more attractive than ipc displays2. Battery is good. With 50 percent u can use for 7 hrs with watching 2movies in the gap3. Front cam is nice. Rear cam is poor. Not  worth4. Dolby atmos... though not really the case coz compared this to s9 of my friend.. s9 sounded real dolby not m30 that too can switched on when u put earphones on.. nonetheless volume will be bit louder if u turn it onCons1.  Frequently it lags. Experienced that trouble in chrome. So 1.8ghz lrocessor not enough go for 2.3 processor.2. User interface is not that good.3. Too many inbuilt samsung apps and google apps. Also no INBUILT APP LOCK this becomes a trouble when u want to install applock app.. if some one uninstall ur app then no security..  only inbuilt app can provide this facility3. MOVING FILES FROM INT MEM TO SD CARD IT TAKING TOO MUCH TIME.  Irritates me4. No vibration sensor. Also if u lock the phone and try fingerprint it should stay on display but it wont show display if u put wrong finger.5. Earphones should have been given. Conclusion  Not worth for 11999 but worth for 9000 only.. processor matters lot. So go for m30s... or like vivo z1 pro..

New generation phone at affordable price

Pros:1. Display quite smooth and pleasing.2. Don't think about polycarbonate body, build is good.3. Batery backup as compare to 5k is ok.Corns:1. Don't get puzzled by youtube review, camera is just ok as it include AI, pixel is not clear but for social media it will do the job.2. Design i think samsung followed the trend and other brand. My first notch display phone, thought it's gonna be ok, but trust me it looks really odd.3. Speaker sound quality not good, not a bit loud, just a cheap sound like low budget phone.4. Main thing where it comes to PUBG? You wont enjoy the gaming with the frame drop in balanced mode with medium frame rate. Lag is effective , lol the design is poor they have kept the speakar gaap in the bottom side so u will face interruption while gaming, the grip won't go easy as it have headphone jack also in the bottom- left. Which will definitely make u feel odd while gaming in loudspeaker or headphone. Even after 7days of use it has started to lag in basic/normal graphics with medium fram rate.I am a Samsung lover, where as i won't recommend you to waste money on this brand. They don't deserve the frame anymore.Only thing i have now is regret after purchase M30.

It's good but I HATE IT

I thought, Samsung is back with good phones and hence I tried it once again. Samsung is bad choice forever for me. I decided, will never buy Samsung phones in future.I received phone and noticed two major issues with this phone1. It heats up a lot when I travel. Of course, in AC room it will not heated up.2. Noise. So there is no voice clarityI booked return request then I came to know that this phone will not be returned but will be replaced. They inspected this phone and declared that it isn't  any fault in this phoneThey send a so called technical expert at my home. He told me that due to notch, there is not much space to adjust the speaker and mic hence in this model, you will find same voice or noise. For him, it is normal.Regarding heating issue, he told me that upto 46degree you can use it and it will be automatically switched off when it will reach up to 46degree. This phone heated up to 41 to 43 degree after few hours of normal internet use.I used to have Redmi note 3S. It was better than this mobile.I am suffering with this mobile without any help and support from Amazon and Samsung

Not upto Samsung Brand value

I made a mistake buying this mobile. So many told me not to buy Samsung mobile for its slowness and network issues, still I went ahead and bought it thinking by now Samsung quality would have bettered but nope. So many issues! First the mobile box had tampered, it looked like very old stock with dirty box. Then the box had only mobile and charger not even screen guard applied. Mobiles back is so plasticky and such a ugly looking! Only the amoled display is worth looking at. Finger print reader is so bad and slow, it takes a while to unlock or react. You doubt whether you properly kept the finger or not.Is been 10 days and phone is ashtray slow. Screen gets hung when some app is open and you get a call. Also, it gets hung when you get a call and try to silence it by pressing start button. Sometimes you feel even touch isn't working but it's because the app reaction is slow in this mobile.Good things I liked are amoled display, dark mode, customizations and some actions given to finger print reader like pulling down navigation bar.

The Note 7 Pro leads in several key aspects.If you are not much into high-end gaming, would value display quality over the camera performance, and are restricted by a budget, the Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint.

If you are thinking about a good budget device then, Go For It.I've used this device for 7 months, in order to know about it current opinion, scroll down.Pros:-1. 5000 MAh Battery capacity!!2. Triple rear Camera.3. 16 MP front camera.4. Full Screen (Notch) Display.5. Super Amoled Display (gives the best colours possible)6. Affordable!Cons:-1. It has Exynos processor for some reasons so you won't get to play very high graphics games very smoothly like you used to with sanpdragon...2. Dosenot have a Metal Body which would have made it more scratch resistant...3. I've heard that its face lock feature isn't that good but I haven't faces any issues with it so far...Edit 1: After using it for a month, mobile suddenly was unable to charge, had to replace the charging port. And you will get a lot of scratches so, a cover is highly recommended!Edit 2: Was Working Good for first 6 months but now, there are quiet a lot of issues like1. Can't use Internet through WiFi.2. Unresponsive incoming call interface.3. Fingerprint sensor barely works.4. Heating problem while charging.5. Weak processor, hence device struggles a lot getting some tasks done.6. Service Center cannot help me with any of these issues... 😐So, here's my final conclusion. If you are laughing to use it for only 5-6 months, it's a biut deal. This device is not for a long run.

Good Camera and Display, Processor not so much

Awasome phone with awasome specification, but i personaly feels phone's big screen sometime difficult to use.Detail review and why I gave 3 start reasons are as follow:Cons first:1. It started heating after 2 months of use that too I am not using it very roughly. In total 24 hours of day i am using it not more than 2 hours (including everything).2. Battery start draining fast compare to initial days. During initial days with the same usage it is used to last for two and half days but now it is lasting not more than one and half day.3. Started hanging up (stopped working). Specially while using camera.4. Camera quality is not as per expectation. Front cemera is okay but rear cemeras not able to capture things in detail. If you click a photo with rear camera and zoom it, the image will start tearing and blurring. Not very effective for students those who are rely on photos for their studies. Its personal experience.5. Fingerprint sensor is little bit slow. It takes 1 or 1.5 seconds to respond.Pros:1. Good and stylish looking phone.2. Adaptive display feature is awasome. No need to change the brightness setting while moving from dark to under sun light or vice versa, it adjust automatically.3. Good torch with adjustable brightness.4. Good sound clearity.I wish most of the cons will be eliminated with software update.And i wish this review will be helpful to the needed one.

A few months after I bought it, the camera stopped working, went to the service centre, they did smthg and sent me back home saying  ""it's good now"" even when I told them to do more thorough checks. Well, I was right and had to go back a couple of days again and had to leave it there because the camera software was apparently damaged ir smthg. After two years  now it's the same problem. It's a good phone, even the camera quality is good. The speakers are ok. But this thing is literally making me want to break it

Don't regret buying this phone one bit

Average phone... you're better off with an Asus or a moto.. the UI is very inconvenient.. takes a lot of getting used to.. even then using the phone is an annoyance rather than second nature.The screen is super bright so that's a plus . And the battery backup is very very good... if it was a more sturdy build would have served a better purpose as a work phone coz you don't have to ask anyone for a damn charger.That stupid pin with which you take the sim slot out should be banned for all phones. Could have had some other mechanism or at least give me a place to keep it..The colour reproduction is okay... seems a bit washed out.Random bugs and lags especially during basic functions like calls... very very annoying.Finally the biggest drawback... the touch accuracy is down the drain... I have to touch min 5 times to pause a damn video... it's a nightmare if I want to skip ahead.So if you need a phone maybe just to call and basic WhatsApp then this is the guy .. doesn't look too shabby... performs alright.. battery is awesomeness.But if you want a little more out of your phone.. just go to the other 5000 mah battery ones.Only reason I got this phone was for the fast charging 5000 mah battery which I wasn't  getting anywhere else.

Received it today.firstly the screen and display is great but the polycarbonate body looks real cheap for this price range.Checked through the settings and apps.well you will not find any lag for now.I believe thats same for all smart phones at this range.Guys dont go for this phone if you are camera savvy, its not the right deal. Although its usp is triple rear camera but its not just that good enough.Wide angle is superb but colour correction and AI control is no atall upto the mark. Note 7 pro, samsung j30 will be ranked way above these model.Front camera is ok and take decent photos.there is a pro mode in camera but not much manual option to p;lay with other that iso and exposure control.Video mode has literally no features.just point and shoot.Atleast expected slowmo and time lapse is 15k budget phone.Battery is good and fast 15w charger was in the package.

A perfect phone at a practical price!

The plus point of this phone is the display, ultra wide camera and the battery life. If you're someone who takes a lot of photos, and consumes a lot of media on there device then this phone is for you.Pros:-sAMOLED Display-Ultra Wide Lens-Battery LifeCons-Slower Processor-Software (Samsung Experience 9.5 looks dated design wise)-Plastic BodyPersonally I haven't noticed much difference in using the AMOLED Display but this might change with time. One thing you might need to keep in mind (I found out about this a little too late) is the processor is closed source so third party ROMs development might not be there. They should have shipped it with Android P and the one UI which is more polished. If you want a phone for camera and media consumption then buy the M30, otherwise if you want a durable phone with better android experience and processor get the Moto One Power.EDIT: After a week of usage I do not find the camera upto the mark, Images lack sharpness and they look a grainy when zoomed in even a bit. This was a huge let down as I expected this phone to have a better camera.

Samsung M30 - a sleek monster

This age samsung phones are nothing, when it comes to feel and user experience. The time the phone was first unboxed, the touch felt hard,but worked without error. Everything else good, camera clearer and real like, clearer than redmi phones, amoled also was ok, definitely amoled, but not very bright and colorful display. The back of phone also was over heating,I called up customer service, they said install all updates, it might change . But even after that, overheating is showing in the processor side and full screen ,when one game starts. The touch problem could not be solved completely, as this was not a appreciable error ,but only weak response and hard touch. I never felt like playing any game with such a touch and poor power behind the handset. Tried all touch repair apps from play store, and reset the phone also, but this never comes to a new phone touch feel. Terrible experience!! Even many China phones do more justice to everything. Samsung phones are only a name sake top notch.

I've never invested more than 8k for the two  smartphones I've used. I'm also not a guy who repeatedly keeps changing phones. So when my previous phone started giving me minor issues, felt it was the right time to buy a new one and upon being suggested by my friend, choose the Samsung m30, 6Gb Ram, 128 Gb variant. It's almost been 3 months since I bought this phone. It's pretty much like all Samsung phones filled with a wide range of applications, user friendly UI etc coupled with few new features.Pros.1. Good camera- Front camera in particular is very good. Also the wide angle rear camera helps you to capture a wider picture.2. Battery- Never ever did I think a smartphone would give a 24hr battery backup. I extensively use my phone for social media apps, netflix, Amazon prime etc but the battery life the phone has got is amazing. You won't even need a powerbank. You also get a fast charger which takes roughly 90 min for one full charge.3. Lockscreen stories- This feature is something new I've come across but nonetheless, is pretty amazing. Helps you keep upto date with the current affairs stories you are interested in while the screen is locked.4. Dolby atmos- Gives you a much better sound experience when using a headset. It is also categorised for various age groups and type of usage such as music, movies etc.Cons.1. Fingerprint sensor - It has been an issue as it doesn't detect your fingerprints sometimes.2. Ringtone- Not sure whether the feature is same for all Samsung phones, but the ringtone automatically increases and decreases. From what I've read across the internet, I've come to know that it is a feature that works based on the surroundings you/the phone is in.All in all, the phone is a decent buy for the price. Suggested for people whose usage is a lot and don't want their battery to drain quickly.

Got this phone around a month ago. My earlier phone was moto g5s plus. I am a moderate user of phone who keeps on hanging with internet and all the required essential  apps, I also  play games at times.Now what good about m 30 for me is:1. Premium  software quality with no ads.2. Excellent display.3. Better performance  compared to my moto phone. This was where I surprised even though on papers this phone has not very powerful processors but still it gives it's best when comes to background  app management. I have not felt any heating issues or lag issues even after using heavy apps for hours!4. Good front camera.5. Excellent  battery  life . Comes around 2.5 days for me.Some cons:1. Even though primary camera is good. But does not give it's best in low light.2. Yes its software is premium with ad free but i was expecting Samsung UI 1 which is available  in A series.3. Speaker could have been amplified more.Overall a very practical  phone which gives u a premium  feel especially  due to its display.Many people compare this with redmi note 7 pro. I agree note 7 pro is a good phone which has better processor but you cannot feel the same premium experience as m 30 here is why:1. Just compare the both display!2. Check out note 7 apps filled with full ads.3. Even though they claim 48 mp it's not always! it it gives u in pro mode with no zoom option.4 microphone and headset audio of m 30 is better.5. Note 7 is a perfect phone for teen agers who is more intrested in gaming or heavy usage. M 30 is for professional  and moderate  users who are more intrested in quality for primary usage of phone.

Good phone but outdated.

Samsung M30 is an excellent value for money. At the price range, it offers competent configurations. I have been using it for over a month and here are my reviews:Over all performance: Satisfactory. Though I bought the 6GB variant, there is no comparable improvement in performance when compared to a 3 GB variant. That being said, I have not observed significant delay in boot time of apps and concurrent background apps continue from the last session rather than re-launching.Camera: I am slightly unhappy with the 13MP primary camera. With the other configurations being competitive, a 13 MP primary camera seems amateurish. The picture quality retains the standard and with ambient light, pictures are of good quality. The 16 MP front camera is impressive and captures good selfie images. The other features of wide angle lens of primary camera, subject focus of both front and rear camera are also impressive and lives up to the expectation.Battery: The 5000 mAh battery is quite a mammoth. Do not expect it to last 2 days though. The idea is that with a good screen use throughout the day, there will still be some juice left in the battery to last the night. This seems reasonable battery backup before charging it up again.Media: The display and video effects are quite good. The DolbyAtmos needs a special mention which gives a notch to the audio experience when an ear phone is plugged in.OS: I received Oxygen in the boxed set and was a big disappointed. But Samsung released Pie with One UI within a month and this elated my mood.Overall its a very good smart phone to use at this price point. It would have been a nice though to include a silicone back cover and a screen guard in the box.If brand is of importance to you, then Samsung M30 will be worthy choice for you to consider.

AN EXCELLENT OPTION -VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY

First, i don't play game.Second, my primary purpose of buying this phone is watching web series and movies through Amazon Prime Videos and doind daily  normal uses.In Highest quality there is a option to download videos through prime videos is 1.8Gb/hr but honestly it will download only lass than 1Gb data in highest quality. The best part is you can play Prime videos in whole screen like which is not able to play in Redmi Note 8, which is also a full hd display phone.In realme 3 pro the maximum download quality option available is 2.3 Gb/hr, so it download better quality videos as compared  to Samsung galaxy M30 or Redmi Note 8.If your purpose is not watching prime videos than go for Redmi 8, yes simply 8, which has the best battery backup i have ever experienced. Lasts for 2 day through intense use.You can't compare the video quality through youtube or a video in your sd card ( videos will look approximately same in all these phones) but when you will start watching online contents (Amazon prime videos,  Netflix  etc) then there will be a major difference between these phones.Samsung M30 Android 10 experience after updates is very smooth. You can uninstall majority of preinstalled apps like Google play music, movies, books etc which you can't do in Redme note 8 and Realme 3 pro. There will be many advertisements in the realme and redme in there pre installed apps which you can't uninstall or even disable,but not in Samsung M30.For daily uses 3gb ram and 32gb memory of m30 is more than enough i didn't experience any lag or hang,works smoothly.

This phone's quality and features r inexplicable bcoz u can't explain feelings, buy this today

I have been using this mobile for quite some time now and to give a gist I have to say that there are a few compromises made to give consumers some decent specs.Some good stuff,Battery life is amazing.It gives me 1.5 days of power and still there is some 15% mostly remaining. Only 30% is sufficient to drive your day with normal usage of emails, songs and 30 mins of YouTube.Charges fastLittle more than half an hour is sufficient for 45% charge.CameraYou can not underestimate m30 here, it can take some serious photographs, if you do the settings right.DisplayOnly one word, Wow!SafeOther manufacturers in this range are mostly Chinese and everyone is aware that china is known for data theft. I might be wrong on this but anyways I don't trust these brands anymore.3.5 mm Jack not at top.This is a very specific issue, for me this is good because if you have wired earphones, wire handling becomes very easy.Some bads,Fingerprint scannerIt is the slowest I have ever used, although you will get used to it.BodyI have never used this phone without a cover, ever though it has developed big scratches at it's back. They are noticable even from a distance, if I remove the cover.Wide angle lensIt is there for just name sake, it doesn't take good photographs.Overall if you have used your old phone for quite some time and are looking for a phone for next couple of years, I think this is an option worth considering.Please note that I am not a heavy user!

Samsung has really created a masterpiece. I have been using it for the last 10 days. I have used other Samsung phones but this one is something different. Here, I am listing the pros and cons of this mobile phone.Pros -1- The battery is great. 5000 mah battery give you more than a full day backup on moderate use. The power saving mode of Samsung is worth going for. Use it wisely and I guess the juice will not run out for 2 or more days. I have tried that recently while I was traveling.2- Display is awesome. It feels.3- Design is also great. I have the blue one and it looks beautiful. The navigation settings let you make the navigation buttons disappear and you experience a better screen.4- The fast charging works really fast.5- Camera is great. Both front and back. Especially in low light conditions. Flash is awesome. Zoom is also great.6- No Hybrid slot is what I seek in the phones these days. Thus, you are not limited by the storage issue if you are using the dual sim.7- Dual 4g is good. Now, I can use my BSNL 3g and at the same time, my Jio works fine.8- Face recognition and fingerprint unlocking are very fast.9- Touch sensitivity is very much.10- I got 200GB space on One Drive for two years free with this device.Cons -1- The wide angle lens needs some improvement. The picture quality is just OK. But as this is a new experience, I would not say its a major con.2- The placement of earphone is downwards so when you want to use your phone earphone and charger plugged in, it becomes a little difficult to operate.For now, this is my experience, I'll keep updating.

SAMSUNG Galaxy M30 is simply great Phone from SAMSUNG under Rs.15000/-

I have always been a Samsung user and am always appreciating Samsung for their amazing services.I was looking for a new device and I was very head bent on the Samsung M30 the day I saw it.I am using the 4 + 64GB version in blue and it works just so well!!I am very happy with my device and recommend it to everyone looking for something in the price range.The 50000 mAh battery is just so helpful and very rare in mobiles, with normal usage on Wifi I get upto 3 full days of battery backup!And also you can fully charge the phone with the fast charger from 0 to 100 in just 2-3 hrs!The features are just unlimited and the device feels actually premium to use.An added feature of Samsung is that the phone damage can be repaired almost anywhere you are and it won't even cost you much.Plus Samsung is both, durable and reliable, even with the 4GB RAM I can play games with a lot of clarity!The device also doesn't heat up!The screen is vivid and almost every setting can be customized very easily and effectively for every person.The Samsung in-built apps might seem like a burden, but if you turn off the notifications, they're really helpful in gaming and multitasking!I have never experienced any system error in this device, if I have got any, it is due to some error I made, for which I was helped by the Samsung online chat service step by step.Samsung phones also have many many in-built features like antivirus, automatic cache memory cleaner and device booster that improve the performance of the product.With smart view one can connect easily to almost any TV set for screen mirroring. And the camera quality is just so cool! I don't even need to search for wallpapers, I can easily just take out my phone, look for a scene I like and click!Whatever I say is less, this phone is a must buy!The best choice ever!!

I recently bought a Galaxy M30 phone and I am fully satisfied with it. Thanks to the 6GB RAM, there is no perceptible delay in processing any command. Then there is the 128 GB Memory, which is more than a match for the videos which one gets very frequently on WhatsApp groups. The 5000 aAh battery enables it to run for two days without charging. Thanks to the C type charging cable, it gets fully charged in about an hour (earlier, I had to charge my phone each night, but sometimes I ran out of juice by evening).Feature by feature, M30 is better than the J8 I was using earlier, but it cost me less than what I paid for J8 less than a year ago. M30 also compares quite well with the higher priced A50 which my nephew uses - the specifications are nearly identical, but the camera is superior in M30.This phone is described as ""Made for India"" and Samsung seems to have done away with all the frills in terms of packaging - in other words, the box is quite flimsy. Apart from the handset itself, all you get is a data cable, a travel adaptor and an ejection pin - there are no earphones which used to be a standard accessory in earlier models. However, no compromises have been made in the specifications and the manufacturing quality of the phone itself.On the whole, an excellent option for Samsung fans - the latest features and very good value for money too!

We can easily get 10-12. Hrs of screentime in this device.Moving on to the charger it has USB type-C port which is actually a good thing. The charger is a fast charger that is 9 Volts at 1.6 ampere.Coming on to the device it has a polycarbonate back with gradiant colour i.e. at the top it is more bluish and becomes black at the bottom. It actually gives it a premium look and also at the back we have finger unlock sensor.In addition it has a dual SIM slot(both 4G) plus a dedicated micro SD slot also which is a nice thing as well.Its memory is expandable up to 512 gb.The phone has Android oreo 8.1 and Samsung Experience 9.5 UI.It's a good phone with good built quality and I like all the features especially the tripple camera setup.

This Phone is above this world of android phones.""FINGERPRINT READER"" is as good as the eye power of detecting objects in 1/16th of a second.And when I say ""BATTERY LIFE"", you can talk more than 24 hours in single full charge. U can use internet as much as you can by charging once in a day. U can play games, listen to music (YouTube) , video calling and much more u can do. This phone has that much battery life, you will forget when was the last time you charged the phone.U always don't need to bring your charger with you, if you are on a one day outing.And it's FAST CHARGING"" is also amazing, the phone takes approx 40 minutes to full charge.Without using internet, I can guess, u can use the phone for minimum 3/4 days.And one more thing, ULTRA POWER SAVING MODE, after applying this mode u can use the phone for a complete day even in 10% charging and u can use 6-8 Apps in this mode, u can use internet too.And I thinking I don't need to review it's CAMERAS bcoz I have no words to praise the cameras, Such amazing high quality pictures with amazing filters of different colours , u can record videos in very high resolution.When we talk about SCREEN, it has very attractive and colourful screen, when u touch u can feel the smoothness. Pixels of the screen are very good, u can use YouTube upto 4K.And when we talk about RAM and INTERNAL STORAGE u have 4 GB Ram and 64 GB internal storage, you will NEVER face HANG problem.And it is just a overview, there is much much more in this phone, u will never regret buying this phone.I strongly recommend this phone to each and everyone. I'm using it since June , from that day I haven't faced any problem.

Worst phone money can buy.

First of all I would like to inform you that I am writing this review after 2month of purchase of m30 black 4gb ram. This is the best in in mid range of 15k. Phone has got its update i.e. android 9 which is awesome. Phone has super battery performance.once fully charged phone can run up to 2 days in normal usage. Phone is awesome for gaming user but I will recommend them to got with 6gb ram variants. Talking with phone design the front panel is looking sexy,and as well as back.one issue with back panel is that it is very slippery you need to handle it properly if you didn't have back cover.coming with camera quality front 16 megapixel is awesome I can't imagine the picture quality in this range of phone only issue with front camera is low light issues.secondly if we talk about primary camera it's too good.triple camera with wide angle is awesome.even low light is not a big deal.i have posted some pictures for camera quality. Talking about fingerprints it is placed little above so in starting you will face some issues while using it but at later stage it will be okay for you. For charging they had provided type c charger which is very much cool. Full phone will get charged within less than 2hrs reason as battery is 5000 mah so it is taking some time but if you charging for 30 mins also it's enough for 5 to 6 hrs. Only think which I am disappointed is that they didn't provide earphone Talking about overall performance phone is awesome I had used it for 2months and personally I am very much satisfied with phone performance Samsung had done wonderful job in mid segment price range. I would also thank Amazon India which delivers the product within 1 day. If you desire any phone under 15k m30 is best which I will recommend.

Camera - Triple rear camera (13+5+5 MP) with 16 MP selfie camera is simply awesome.7. Sound - Dolby Atmos sound with active noise cancelation, functioning great.8. Sensors - Fingerprint sensor is rear mounted and believe me till date no issue with the sensor, working pretty smoothly.9. Battery - Li-Po 5000 mAh battery with Fast battery charging 15W, Full charge completes within 1.5 hours if you put charge at 15% battery remaining and trust my according my usage it stays for whole 2 days after normal usage of device.10. Miscellaneous - Wi-Fi 802.11, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS is there, FM Radio with recording, USB 2.0 Type-C with reversible connector and most important SAR of galaxy M30 is 0.41 W/kg (Low radiation)After using it for about 4 months it's all well and simply amazing.Thank you SAMSUNG and AMAZON for making my life awesome.- Nilendu Saha (Kolkata, West Bengal)

I bought this for my 2 daughter who had kidnapped my wife's AND my phone everyday and refuses to give it until we threaten them with the police/indian army/indian airforce etc.My married life was going to hell, my wife was irritated and frustrated, she was threatening with divorce. Everyday once we reach home our phones disappears and only appears once our daughters go to school in the morning. I had to check my mails in my laptop instead of my phone which is more convenient as well. Many days I leave office late so that I have my phone in my possession, and this was causing health problems for me.I was on a crucial turining point in my life.Then I saw this AD from Samsung. My life was about to change for ever.I placed order and it was delivered in the same day.And our life was reset. We were back to early days of our daughters who would happily ignore me and my wife's existence and just do thier own stuff without any troubles.Once we bought this phone, we are leading a happy life. Our phones no more disappears, I can leave my phone on a table or sofa and goto toilet and come back with the phone being in the excat same place where I had left it.It was bliss.And I can check my mails in my own phone instead of laptop. My wife has also started loving me again, she dropped the idea of divorcing me.We are only little happy family because of M30.Ah about the phone, its a excellent phone, just go ahead and buy it.

Samasung's high priority Bug

Pros:> Display is very cool. On par with flagship phones.> Battery life is great.> Camera quality is fair, comparing it with previous generation samsung phones.> Touch is very smooth. Much smoother than the competition redmi note 7 pro. And also a better display than the same.> fast charger is included in the box!> Widevine L1 certified, so you can watch shows and youtube videos in HD.> really good fast charging. Goes from 10 to 100 percent in 2 hours, and then lasts 2 days with moderate usage. Even a quick 10 minutes charge will help you keep your phone alive for the rest of your day.> triple camera setup with a wide angle lens for great landscape pictures.Cons> processor not powerful enough. Not a good choice for hardcore gamers. But you can play games on low quality.> night camera is okayish. Could have been better.> no 4k video, not even 60fps option in the videos, so there is no slowmo either.> Aspect ratio is a bit odd. Videos are slighty zoomed in on apps. Even instagram stories are slightly zoomed in to fit on screen. There must be a way to change it but I have yet to discover the setting.> No gorilla glass and polycarbonate back. Both sides are prone to scratches.But it if:You are a student and spend a lot of time on phone studying and taking notes.If you want to watch shows online and youtube in good quality.If you want a phone that lasts long (in terms of battery).Don't buy if you want a high-performance phone.Rating: 8/10. The phone is good for its price. You won't get this display at this price in any other phone. The battery and fast charging are a nice addition.

I bought the 6GB+128GB Black variant. First of all, for people who are complaining about unable to play PUBG, FOR GOD'S SAKE INCREASE YOUR BUDGET OR GO FOR OTHER BRANDs. This phone is for people who are looking for a better display, long battery life and Advertisement free OS (sick of Xiaomi).Battery- I get around 8+ hrs of screen ontime with 50% brightness. My phone is connected to Wifi 95% of the time with 2 4G connections running in the background. I have multiple BT devices which were operated through this phone. I have been torrenting, listening to music, watching videos in YT, Netflix, calling for 2+ hrs, texting, trying out new apps etc and still left with 15% battery. Although, fast charger of 15 W is orovided with the phone but I use a 18W MI charger. Now thats a battery😀Screen- Its super Amoled screen, therefore, the video quality is extremy good  The colors are correctly saturated with deep blacks making video watching a pleasant experience. It also comes with L1 Widevine support, so you can stream videos in HD. Overall, a very good display in this budget.OS- Not as good as stock android ( yes I prefer stock android) but comes with a lot of customization which increases the productivity. However, there are no irritating advertisements anywhere in the OS unlike Xiaomi phones.Operation- Smooth so far with good RAM management. I did not face any lag whike using multiple apps. But a few more updates to One UI will be good.Storage- You get 100+ GB free when you boot the phone for the first time and you get a dedicated SD card slot.Camera- I prefer DSLR for photos, however, for casual shots, its ok.

Big Warning!!

Below is the experience so far.1. Received a defective product. Battery was getting drained out in few hours, wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble,  including Google maps. (Location was not getting captured)2. Tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app I open. (tried on 7th night as well, but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile - Amazon app was in this phone. Used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile)3. Amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6. First visit to center, they did a software update (3 week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending) and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. Faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. Second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn't allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they don't have the authority for that.10. Called customer care number again, and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the seller.So back to step 3. Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , If I manage to reach there.Update :11. All customer care said they can't replace the phone. So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. Again, whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again.12. I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist (battery was draining out by the minute). I showed it to them. They told me it's a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. They also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. Used for 2 days. Same situation. No improvement.13. Went back to them again. They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience.17. I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. They refused with all their might and said ""phone is working now"". During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. I officially registered a complaint. But still no luck of returning the phone.Update on Nov 30th.18. I was traveling and outside the country. On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70% charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980's. Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times. No luck. Still grid lines. My flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip.19. Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. (Nov 30th.) Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. They mentioned ""patch issue. Software update dint happen"" . At this point, I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. No 3 month old phone's screen will stop responding because of software update missing. They are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.

Worst phone from Samsung
","
It was an awful GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL'22 for me. I bundle ordered this phone along with a pathetic mattress from Wakefit. The mattress got cancelled 3 days after scheduled delivery, and this phone does not even work.4 hours into using it, I was on a phone call and suddenly it makes a lot of noise that goes away on speaker mode only to return upon turning the speaker OFF. While still continuing with the speaker mode, the call was dropped. After repeated attempts to place the call I realized SIM 1 is not recognized. I turned off and reinserted a different SIM, and it still read NO SIM 1. There is this obnoxious heating part which I discounted in the initial few hours, but it only got worse in that limited time this phone worked.Soon it started going insane, restarting every few seconds and I was tired after a long day at work. I just dropped it on my study table to go to sleep and whole night it gave a DJ lighting effect while turning ON and OFF all on its own!This is not even the worst, I contacted Amazon; a TECHNICAL EXPERT says she couldn't initiate a return/refund on this product. She rechecked only to say not possible. She can only exchange the phone that too after a diagnosis by their expert who will visit me 3 days later! Like I said in the first paragraph, I reminded her off my mattress that was cancelled from their end. She feels so SORRY about it, but wont accept return. That's rich! They are okay with seller cancelling the delivery without informing the customer, that too after making the customer wait for 11 days. But they won't accept a return on an insane piece of crap that they call M53.I asked her to transfer the call to the team that will answer about my mattress and she did. This guy seems sensible and accepted the return in few minutes of explaining the issue. He promptly arranged for the return pick-up next day. This was the Amazon India I have known for years, but now! I returned the phone after a lot of effort and currently waiting for the refund as I type this.To try a non-Chinese midrange phone I have gone for this, but now I wouldn't dare to buy a Samsung phone again.

Mobile data, Bluetooth and WiFi not working at all

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the recently purchased product which is the Samsung M53 5G. I am really disappointed with the phone and the service centre. I have faced plenty of problems.Let me explain problems in the detail. I purchased a cell phone on 16th May 2022. It worked well for a couple of days. As I continued to use it, I found faults in the handset. Firstly, it played random noise at random times at any point in time. Thus, to fix it I went to the service centre. I explained everything to the service centre. They said that the latest software update would fix the problem so they took their time and updated the software. After a couple of days, new issue raised. i.e., the screen of the phone blacked out automatically. Nothing seemed to work when the screen was off. This was really frustrating.I don’t understand how the new phone within 15 days of purchase can work like a faulty piece? I chose this phone over Apple and OnePlus after considering all the factors and it seems to be the wrong choice for me after all. The surprising thing is when I asked the centre to replace the phone as it was creating a lot of problems and I can’t every time leave my office to fix the issues they denied and said we could do it if it is within 14 days from the date of purchase. However, it was 15 days so they did not do it. I really think this is a ridiculous way of taking care of customers.My phone is in WARRANTY (ONLY BEEN 15 DAYS)!Never purchase samsung phone!! Terrible experienceA REALLY FRUSTRATED CUSTOMER!!

Samsung low range, mid range(upto 50k) mobile phone just sell only for brand & our mind is set for non Chinese brand, other wise Samsung make most third class phone in this price brand,A. No very good build quality (cheap type plstic & paint) B. Always use low quality processor (exenyos or or low end midiatek)C. Always use Samsung sensor for camera in this range, i have 20mp old dual camera HONOR phone, much much better than 108mp(only for show)D. Its amoled skin is only good part but that time he use below 400ppi & lower brightness (not proper show in sunlight)E. In few months lag also comingD. Only 25w charging speed,Now new technic no charger in tbe box,No screen guard applied, no back cover, no 3.5mm converter jack in the box. (local converter not work properly, only original Samsung converter will work, which price almost 800rs..now not available in Samsung store)This brand only running for our government support.. Nothing else..In this price range or below u get much much good quality phone in the market..My old phone was almost 4 years but camera is much better than & performance, display also very good.Samsung midrange just waist of the money..

This phone has lots of cons that still need to be upgraded. The price range should be 16000 to 20000 only.Battery is average ( was draining fast even when not in use ), Fingerprint is slow, Display is somehow good.The most bug that I detected from samsung is that there's a call sound problem ( both on loud as well as ear ) from the day of purchase.When I was calling someone else, call sound was high, I tried to down call volume on both Loudspeaker and ear speaker, but that remained same i.e. high. The call sound is not getting down, I restarted phone but still same issue. Second issue was with mic, The other person on call could not hear my voice ( with focus mode On/Off ) properly. Every time my voice was so less to the receiver, so had to talk loudly.Both these two issues were resolved automatically after 2 days ( don't know how ) for a short time. Then again faced.Thought that it maybe occurred with some phone's setting, therefore I called customer care from samsung. He said that you've to call Amazon customer care ( the product you purchased from ).So I called to amazon customer care and told the issue, they checked and offered me to return the phone.I returned this product.Also I had purchased Samsung Galaxy M32 5G about 9 months ago. After 7 days of software update in current month the same above mentioned problem I'm facing. However this problem was resolved temporarily when I rebooted but after 1 day again the same issue.This is so high glitch on samsung that disappointed me.I gave one star rating.

Gone for a Samsung phone after using MI n Oppo for last 7yrs and the experience is worst.My previous Oppo k1 is still much better than this phone which I thought I am upgrading.- Battery backup is not that good- Phone performance is not upto the mark, response time is lagging, doesn't feel like 6gb ram- Camera quality definitely doesn't justify the price- Automatic brightness is fully responsive- Contacts getting deleted automatically- Call settings got changed automatically twice.Only one good thing that justify the price and brand name is the display but if u need an overall good phone. Pls go for MI, Oppo, Vivo.No customer service after so many complains and tweets ..no one is bothering to call alsoWorst Exp - This is my last gadget of Samsung

 I was planning not to go for samsung M53 initially but previously I was using galaxy f41 which was quite fine especially the battery life. Thought I can now trust samsung blindly after that. Not knowing I will be sorry for that. First of all they removed the adapter from the box and selling it separately before that they used to troll Apple for removing adapter from the box. But the real problem was when I bought the original samsung adapter for the same it was working fine for 10-12 days but after that it was not charging M53 but charging other phones, I thought my phone has some issue but to my surprise when I plug into other charger it was charging the real irony was it was not charging the phone for which it was bought for. Not only this this phone has serious battery drain issue, i always put on battery saver yet it hardly last for a day. Hanging is also there and when the battery completely drains you have to put it for 4-5 hours of charging. I don't care about the camera.

The product was delivered on 21st Novemeber'22. From the 23rd, mobile data, WiFi and Bluetooth stopped working completely. When I searched for the solution online, several others reported the same issues with no solution. Store-based sellers are not offering the model and its service for the same problems. We made the mistake of relying solely on amazon reviews, where these problems were not mentioned. Please refrain from buying this model.

1. Finger print sensor is not that smooth.2. Display screen is pathetic specially during night or in dim light.3. Camera quality is also not as expected. I would rate 0 for camera quality.4.

This phone is like Arrange marriage. you will get this phone online only that means you can not see it before you buy.The phone is a collection of extremely cheap parts. Samsung does not give the charger and that is OK as they told it upfront. But the cable sent with the phone is so bad that below the metro station a 60 rupees cable is better than what is hipped by Amazon.neither  front and rear the camera are upto the mark. The performance is also too slow. Do not misguide yourself by fancy specifications.The speaker are also very  normal and similar to the phone 8000 which you can not hear even when you are alone in room...I can challenge if the voice is clear and loud than my iphone5.All you can do after buying this Samsung phone is write a review on Amazon which neither Samsung not Amazon will bother. So my recommendation is do not play blind with these Online only models and better  buy what you see. Once you see what you like buy it from anywhereyou can google ""Samsung phone restart problem"". You can find yourself how people are victim of Samsung online only

I used this device only for last 3 Days and based on it my feedback is1. WIFI - Very unstable and frequently  getting  disconnected  even my other device is connected  with same wifi.2. If I disabled  my WiFi and  trying to enable it again, It doesn't  enable  again and I need to reboot  my device3. SIM slot is not good, my micro SIM which get fit perfectly  does not fit in Samsung  M53 5G SIM slot and I have to push it to fit.4. Device  operation  based on 8Gb RAM is not upto mark when compared  with 8GB OPPO similar configuration device.Overall very average for me Samsung Galaxy M53 5G experience.

M52 4g is better than this. As I have to charge it two times. Only camera quality is good. About 5g it is not launched in Pune's all areas. And 4g is enough to do your all activities. Don't buy it only for the sake of 5g. If you check 5g speed in spedtest it will consume 1gb of data only to check speed. So it's better to use 4g if you want to save data. I am mising my M52 for battery.

After long time I have decided to move from non-Chinese Mobile and I purchased Samsung M53. after buying this product I realized that this product is not having the basic functionality which I have been using since 2017. Can’t disconnect call by power button. Vibration when call connected and disconnected. Internet speed throughput Screenshot by Three finger moving on screen. Touch is not good. Some time multiple time has do move finger to receive call.Etc.

phone okay, but not happy with (1) no audio jack port (2) no USB cable.The description says data cable, but both ends of the cable is C-type. This is good only for a phone to phone to connect. Not sure why phone to phone connection is mandatory as part of a phone purchase but a charging cable is not provided. One way, companies advocate to use an original adaptor and charging cable, but they instead provide only phone-to-phone connecting data transfer cable, which lets the users buy generic adaptors/charging cables. Samsung would have given a USB cable instead of a data transfer cable.And also, no Audio jack. The only option now is to go for a Bluetooth headset. I'm not a fan of Bluetooth headsets, but no option left now.

I am sharing 7th day of my new m53 mobile video and find it is hanging. Here auto data mobile data from one sim to other is not found working in my phone, sim one data overe other have to manually change. Battry back is disappointing, in my new mobile purchase 100% charge mobile worked 1/2day only. Due to C to C cable we can't connect it with laptop or computer. No having adopoter is disappointing.But it have many good things also that is attractive. It have some bad things but still I recommend because having other good Feacheurs.

This phone is severely lacking not just in terms of basic functionality but also on the hardware side.Bought this for 7k rs. But it feels like a phone stuck in 2014.The display resolution is just 720p and it isn't even an led panel. Further more, there have been some decent budget phones with 8/12MP cameras but this is not one of them. The camera quality is laughable, while the image resolution offered by both front and back cameras is pretty high, the sensor is either too small or the image processing software is terrible and the image comes off looking like a painting or a glob of unsharpened pixels. Color accuracy and low light photography both are completely non existent so if you even intend to take decent pictures with this phone, it's just not possible.That isn't even the worst part tho, the OS that ships with this phone is so horribly lacking basic features like a basic DND button in the taskbar to put the phone on silent quickly. Pretty much every setting that can be found on the top menu on regular phones is usually hidden in some settings menu here, it just makes it harder to find what you're looking for. It also doesn't have a dedicated media player so if you want to play movies or music you'll have to download VLC first.There are some things I can commend about this phone, one of them is the display. While it isn't an HD display, the colors are fine for an LCD, it can also get pretty dark making it easier on the eyes. While the OS is a stripped down version of Android 11, it comes with some open source software instead of Google bloat giving it much better performance. And the battery life is easily the best thing, battery lasts around 1.5 days even with regular usage due to the less bloated software.Finally, don't buy this phone if you're looking for a decent budget smartphone, I'd recommend spending 3k-4k more and buying a redmi note 10 or 11. But if you're really locked into a tight budget or buying a phone for a student/older person, this isn't a bad choice

In 10 min, there is no display on phone. Assuming low battery, we have connected for charging. After 1 hour also, no display on.Took it to service center. No damage identified on the outside. There is a signal link break between display and motherboard. I guess it is the wire bus.It does not come under warranty it seems. They claim that it must have happened because of phone fall on the backside. Boss ! ThERE is no FALL. No hint of damage on the external, buy I side online broke-- and no warranty!!!

So I tried for a replacement, but i saw it can be replaced with same model. So even if,i didnt open the pack,i was forced to use it. It's a great lesson learnt.

The phone is good for average user and will not give any issue for about 2 years, 90 Hz ambled display, massive battery, decent camera, processor could have been better. Plus the offer for 3 months prime subscription is bogus, when I tried to redeem coupon it says already used. So overall I will give 3 out of 5 for overall offer from Samsung and Amazon.

Samsung with other processes (mediatech, sanp dragon) is better than Exynos. So if you are trying to this mobile for your parents is a better option. For gamer's it's not suggested. Simply buy this mobile who you only hello hello, what's app and to surf social media and news feeds.Camera is comfortable for normal users.I am getting two days of battery life on full charge with 5000mah battery.

Below is the experience so far.1. Received a defective product. Battery was getting drained out in few hours, wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble,  including Google maps. (Location was not getting captured)2. Tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app I open. (tried on 7th night as well, but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile - Amazon app was in this phone. Used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile)3. Amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now I need to call Samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. Called Samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. Informed I will have to visit the Samsung service center to figure out the issue6. First visit to center, they did a software update (3 week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending) and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. They also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. Faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. Second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. I requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn't allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. They told me I will have to contact Samsung customer case number again if I want a product replacement as they don't have the authority for that.10. Called customer care number again, and they inform me I have to contact Amazon for product replacement as Amazon was the seller.So back to step 3. Will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , If I manage to reach there.Update :11. All customer care said they can't replace the phone. So surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. They gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. Again, whipped out of the apps which I had downloaded and logged in again.12. I checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and I figured the problem still persist (battery was draining out by the minute). I showed it to them. They told me it's a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. They also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. They asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. Used for 2 days. Same situation. No improvement.13. Went back to them again. They checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. Technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. I have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. By this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. They kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. Phone started functioning normally finally but I was sick and tired of the experience.17. I called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. They refused with all their might and said ""phone is working now"". During the process I also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. I officially registered a complaint. But still no luck of returning the phone.Update on Nov 30th.18. I was traveling and outside the country. On Nov 21st while using the phone and with 70% charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some TV from 1980's. Tried switching of the Mobile and restarting multiple times. No luck. Still grid lines. My flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. Friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till I completed the trip.19. Reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. (Nov 30th.) Am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. They mentioned ""patch issue. Software update dint happen"" . At this point, I know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. No 3 month old phone's screen will stop responding because of software update missing. They are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund.

Worst phone from Samsung
","
It was an awful GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL'22 for me. I bundle ordered this phone along with a pathetic mattress from Wakefit. The mattress got cancelled 3 days after scheduled delivery, and this phone does not even work.4 hours into using it, I was on a phone call and suddenly it makes a lot of noise that goes away on speaker mode only to return upon turning the speaker OFF. While still continuing with the speaker mode, the call was dropped. After repeated attempts to place the call I realized SIM 1 is not recognized. I turned off and reinserted a different SIM, and it still read NO SIM 1. There is this obnoxious heating part which I discounted in the initial few hours, but it only got worse in that limited time this phone worked.Soon it started going insane, restarting every few seconds and I was tired after a long day at work. I just dropped it on my study table to go to sleep and whole night it gave a DJ lighting effect while turning ON and OFF all on its own!This is not even the worst, I contacted Amazon; a TECHNICAL EXPERT says she couldn't initiate a return/refund on this product. She rechecked only to say not possible. She can only exchange the phone that too after a diagnosis by their expert who will visit me 3 days later! Like I said in the first paragraph, I reminded her off my mattress that was cancelled from their end. She feels so SORRY about it, but wont accept return. That's rich! They are okay with seller cancelling the delivery without informing the customer, that too after making the customer wait for 11 days. But they won't accept a return on an insane piece of crap that they call M53.I asked her to transfer the call to the team that will answer about my mattress and she did. This guy seems sensible and accepted the return in few minutes of explaining the issue. He promptly arranged for the return pick-up next day. This was the Amazon India I have known for years, but now! I returned the phone after a lot of effort and currently waiting for the refund as I type this.To try a non-Chinese midrange phone I have gone for this, but now I wouldn't dare to buy a Samsung phone again.

 I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the recently purchased product which is the Samsung M53 5G. I am really disappointed with the phone and the service centre. I have faced plenty of problems.Let me explain problems in the detail. I purchased a cell phone on 16th May 2022. It worked well for a couple of days. As I continued to use it, I found faults in the handset. Firstly, it played random noise at random times at any point in time. Thus, to fix it I went to the service centre. I explained everything to the service centre. They said that the latest software update would fix the problem so they took their time and updated the software. After a couple of days, new issue raised. i.e., the screen of the phone blacked out automatically. Nothing seemed to work when the screen was off. This was really frustrating.I don’t understand how the new phone within 15 days of purchase can work like a faulty piece? I chose this phone over Apple and OnePlus after considering all the factors and it seems to be the wrong choice for me after all. The surprising thing is when I asked the centre to replace the phone as it was creating a lot of problems and I can’t every time leave my office to fix the issues they denied and said we could do it if it is within 14 days from the date of purchase. However, it was 15 days so they did not do it. I really think this is a ridiculous way of taking care of customers.My phone is in WARRANTY (ONLY BEEN 15 DAYS)!Never purchase samsung phone!! Terrible experienceA REALLY FRUSTRATED CUSTOMER!!

Don't ever buy this mobile...worst mobile ever!

Samsung low range, mid range(upto 50k) mobile phone just sell only for brand & our mind is set for non Chinese brand, other wise Samsung make most third class phone in this price brand,A. No very good build quality (cheap type plstic & paint) B. Always use low quality processor (exenyos or or low end midiatek)C. Always use Samsung sensor for camera in this range, i have 20mp old dual camera HONOR phone, much much better than 108mp(only for show)D. Its amoled skin is only good part but that time he use below 400ppi & lower brightness (not proper show in sunlight)E. In few months lag also comingD. Only 25w charging speed,Now new technic no charger in tbe box,No screen guard applied, no back cover, no 3.5mm converter jack in the box. (local converter not work properly, only original Samsung converter will work, which price almost 800rs..now not available in Samsung store)This brand only running for our government support.. Nothing else..In this price range or below u get much much good quality phone in the market..My old phone was almost 4 years but camera is much better than & performance, display also very good.Samsung midrange just waist of the money..

This phone has lots of cons that still need to be upgraded. The price range should be 16000 to 20000 only.Battery is average ( was draining fast even when not in use ), Fingerprint is slow, Display is somehow good.The most bug that I detected from samsung is that there's a call sound problem ( both on loud as well as ear ) from the day of purchase.When I was calling someone else, call sound was high, I tried to down call volume on both Loudspeaker and ear speaker, but that remained same i.e. high. The call sound is not getting down, I restarted phone but still same issue. Second issue was with mic, The other person on call could not hear my voice ( with focus mode On/Off ) properly. Every time my voice was so less to the receiver, so had to talk loudly.Both these two issues were resolved automatically after 2 days ( don't know how ) for a short time. Then again faced.Thought that it maybe occurred with some phone's setting, therefore I called customer care from samsung. He said that you've to call Amazon customer care ( the product you purchased from ).So I called to amazon customer care and told the issue, they checked and offered me to return the phone.I returned this product.Also I had purchased Samsung Galaxy M32 5G about 9 months ago. After 7 days of software update in current month the same above mentioned problem I'm facing. However this problem was resolved temporarily when I rebooted but after 1 day again the same issue.This is so high glitch on samsung that disappointed me.I gave one star rating.

Gone for a Samsung phone after using MI n Oppo for last 7yrs and the experience is worst.My previous Oppo k1 is still much better than this phone which I thought I am upgrading.- Battery backup is not that good- Phone performance is not upto the mark, response time is lagging, doesn't feel like 6gb ram- Camera quality definitely doesn't justify the price- Automatic brightness is fully responsive- Contacts getting deleted automatically- Call settings got changed automatically twice.Only one good thing that justify the price and brand name is the display but if u need an overall good phone. Pls go for MI, Oppo, Vivo.No customer service after so many complains and tweets ..no one is bothering to call alsoWorst Exp - This is my last gadget of Samsung

 I was planning not to go for samsung M53 initially but previously I was using galaxy f41 which was quite fine especially the battery life. Thought I can now trust samsung blindly after that. Not knowing I will be sorry for that. First of all they removed the adapter from the box and selling it separately before that they used to troll Apple for removing adapter from the box. But the real problem was when I bought the original samsung adapter for the same it was working fine for 10-12 days but after that it was not charging M53 but charging other phones, I thought my phone has some issue but to my surprise when I plug into other charger it was charging the real irony was it was not charging the phone for which it was bought for. Not only this this phone has serious battery drain issue, i always put on battery saver yet it hardly last for a day. Hanging is also there and when the battery completely drains you have to put it for 4-5 hours of charging. I don't care about the camera.

The product was delivered on 21st Novemeber'22. From the 23rd, mobile data, WiFi and Bluetooth stopped working completely. When I searched for the solution online, several others reported the same issues with no solution. Store-based sellers are not offering the model and its service for the same problems. We made the mistake of relying solely on amazon reviews, where these problems were not mentioned. Please refrain from buying this model.

1. Finger print sensor is not that smooth.2. Display screen is pathetic specially during night or in dim light.3. Camera quality is also not as expected. I would rate 0 for camera quality.4.

This phone is like Arrange marriage. you will get this phone online only that means you can not see it before you buy.The phone is a collection of extremely cheap parts. Samsung does not give the charger and that is OK as they told it upfront. But the cable sent with the phone is so bad that below the metro station a 60 rupees cable is better than what is hipped by Amazon.neither  front and rear the camera are upto the mark. The performance is also too slow. Do not misguide yourself by fancy specifications.The speaker are also very  normal and similar to the phone 8000 which you can not hear even when you are alone in room...I can challenge if the voice is clear and loud than my iphone5.All you can do after buying this Samsung phone is write a review on Amazon which neither Samsung not Amazon will bother. So my recommendation is do not play blind with these Online only models and better  buy what you see. Once you see what you like buy it from anywhereyou can google ""Samsung phone restart problem"". You can find yourself how people are victim of Samsung online only

the battery life is biggest turndown.. it is 5000ah.. but it barely makes it through the day even when GPS, Bluetooth are off through out the day.. the previous Samsung phone i was using (2 years old now) still can go for 2 days on a single charge even when it has less battery size than the new one's..at times the Wi-fi or Hotspot doesnt work.. it automatically gets turned off just a second or 2 after it turns on..for the first time i am disappointed with a Samsung phone..

I used this device only for last 3 Days and based on it my feedback is1. WIFI - Very unstable and frequently  getting  disconnected  even my other device is connected  with same wifi.2. If I disabled  my WiFi and  trying to enable it again, It doesn't  enable  again and I need to reboot  my device3. SIM slot is not good, my micro SIM which get fit perfectly  does not fit in Samsung  M53 5G SIM slot and I have to push it to fit.4. Device  operation  based on 8Gb RAM is not upto mark when compared  with 8GB OPPO similar configuration device.Overall very average for me Samsung Galaxy M53 5G experience.

M52 4g is better than this. As I have to charge it two times. Only camera quality is good. About 5g it is not launched in Pune's all areas. And 4g is enough to do your all activities. Don't buy it only for the sake of 5g. If you check 5g speed in spedtest it will consume 1gb of data only to check speed. So it's better to use 4g if you want to save data. I am mising my M52 for battery.

After long time I have decided to move from non-Chinese Mobile and I purchased Samsung M53. after buying this product I realized that this product is not having the basic functionality which I have been using since 2017. Can’t disconnect call by power button. Vibration when call connected and disconnected. Internet speed throughput Screenshot by Three finger moving on screen. Touch is not good. Some time multiple time has do move finger to receive call.Etc.

phone okay, but not happy with (1) no audio jack port (2) no USB cable.The description says data cable, but both ends of the cable is C-type. This is good only for a phone to phone to connect. Not sure why phone to phone connection is mandatory as part of a phone purchase but a charging cable is not provided. One way, companies advocate to use an original adaptor and charging cable, but they instead provide only phone-to-phone connecting data transfer cable, which lets the users buy generic adaptors/charging cables. Samsung would have given a USB cable instead of a data transfer cable.And also, no Audio jack. The only option now is to go for a Bluetooth headset. I'm not a fan of Bluetooth headsets, but no option left now.

Here auto data mobile data from one sim to other is not found working in my phone, sim one data overe other have to manually change. Battry back is disappointing, in my new mobile purchase 100% charge mobile worked 1/2day only. Due to C to C cable we can't connect it with laptop or computer. No having adopoter is disappointing.But it have many good things also that is attractive. It have some bad things but still I recommend because having other good Feacheurs.

Don't buy Samsung Products.  They are not providing Charging Adapter.  There adapters are costly starting from 1300. (Oppo, Vivo Original Adapters starts from Rs.500). Adapters Quality is very bad.

Worst product

My first, most expensive phone ever. Brought it after 4 years of using a 6k phone  with high hopes as a graduation present. Samsung is a good brand. Even if the phone is defective, it will be  taken care of by the Samsung services. Don't need to worry because it's Samsung, oldest brand that anyone knows. While I brought this phone thinking this, the brand backstabbed like no other. It didn't even last 3 months. And asking customer service multiple times did not help at all. I went 3 times to the service centre despite my exams going on and they said come tomorrow because it takes time to repair , because engineer is not there. And finally refused. Can you imagine using this phone with its touch not working? I couldn't even face my parents after making such an expensive purchase and no usage within 3 months!!! How am I supposed to pay 50k to get it's touch repaired?? Does samsung has no mercy?? I might as well buy two new phones in that 50k and a much better one!!I am so upset and embarrassed. I don't know what to do. It's EMI is still being paid!! 😔  no amount of begging and requesting is helping me to get this phone repaired in warranty.this is so unfair. Feels like I should've brought the 6k phone.wouldnt have lost so much money.

Very poor product. Just forget about the Camera quality. A lot of noise and color variation you will find in the images taken out with this. Especially the front camera, a cheap webcam can take a much better image than this. Just see the noise, brightness issue and color variation in the shirt shown in the image(shirt is a very light colour one but it is coming entirely different in this image and no details of it). Camera is also very laggy in preview mode.Beware that this product once purchased can't be returned or replaced. Amazon will right away deny that mentioning about their policies. Think twice before buying this. In terms of other performance it is somewhat ok but not justifying the amount that we pay for. There are better alternatives available for 19k available from other manufacturers. Quality of the product is not at all justifiable from this price point.

Battery life is superb.Look is good.Other than that connectivity issue-the other person is always unable to hear clearly whenever I make a call(Only WhatsApp calls help).Camera is not that good. You can only expect good pictures when you have good lighting, otherwise forget about good pictures during the night or low light area.Sensor is moody, if it wants to work it'll work if it doesn't wants to, then even after multiple attempts, it'll not read the finger print.Processor is bit slow.  Sometimes gets stuck for several minutes.Overall-Not worth the penny.

Don't go with only the written specs and compare with cheaper fones, quality matters a lot! Trust me.On paper, it is inferior in specs as compared to other brands, and other samsung online-only phones, but This fone is far better in quality than any fone I have used so far. (I have almost always used mid range fones)Pros:1.Good battery life and outstanding stand-by battery ( u sleep at 60%, u get 60% wen u wake up)2. Reception Including Bluetooth is excellent.(I can use use my Bluetooth earphones from next house also! )3. Very premium feel and very smooth touch.4. I don't know how, but this tft display is much clearer and better than many amoled displays of the same range .5. 3yrs of android updates and 4yrs of software updates!6. Samsung charger In the box, u like the online only variants(though it's a 15w charger)Cons:1. Little overpriced maybe...1000to1500 rs, but it compensates for it in the luxury feel, tough built and gorilla5 glass.2. Takes longer to charge since it's upto 25w charging, but I charge the fone once in 2 days, coz it consumes very less power, even while playing gamesDon't listen to the so called you tubers tho are not the real experts on the matter. If you have been using Chinese fones like redmi/realmi/oppo etc then u will surely enjoy this fone , it's smoothness and the premium feel/looks.

My mail to Samsung CEO will clear up the issue I am facing with samsung. I have also attached images.Hi,This is Rahul Godara, owner of a Samsung Galaxy M30. My phone was showing an issue with moisture in USB port which seemed to be just a software glitch and after waiting for a whole day the phone was not charging with the standard samsung charger but the same charger is working with other Xiaomi Remi Note 7. I called the Samsung customer care. They gave me resolution of either updating the device or take it to the Samsung service centre nearby, which unfortunately was TVS electronics in Dwarka ,Ramphal chowk ,sector-7, New Delhi. As I was not able to take the device with me to the centre my mom went there with the device. It was until now that we did not have an issue with a small scratch on the screen (just below the front camera on the bezel but not on the screen or camera) which was promoted in status by the customer care staff to a “crack” in screen. Any way the device did not have any issues with the screen it was just supposed to be charged and may be updated as suggested by the customer care person. The device was bought on 22nd May 2019 i.e. approximately 1 month before this incident. So, we hoped that we would not have to pay anything as we where there for a software issue. The customer care representative came in with the report that it is a crack in the screen and they cannot fix the screen until they get screen fixed for Rs. 6000 /- then only they will fix any other issues which were covered in the warranty. Once again I had no issues with the screen. They were adamant about the scratch being the crack on the screen and asked to either pay and get the phone fixed or they cannot help us.I called the consumer court help line and registered a complaint ( Docket no. 1413754).I received a call from samsung and have been receiving calls for almost one week. I have sent clear pictures of the scratch and have been very patient with he process being followed. But my patience have been wearing thin as the Samsung executive only calls if there is an update done by me to the consumer helping complaint and asking me to wait and never provides a resolution.Is this the type of service samsung is imparting to its customers these days? I was a user of samsung phone ( galaxy note one ) and was very happy with it. The service and everything but had to leave because of similar issues in the past and now we are here again facing similar issues and with a realisation of making the same mistake again hoping samsung doing something better.I had already submitted details of the device to  the samsung executive by the Dilasini Chaudhary in emails with subjects “Reagrding Samsung Device_3730657670” and “Sending more pictures of the scratch”.The details of the device have been updated on the consumer complaint docket no. 1413754.SM-M305F/DSIMEI:xxxxxx/10/xxxxxx/4IMEI:xxxxxxx/10/xxxxxx1/2S/N: xxxxxxxxxxxxWarm regards,LATEST UPDATE: As soon as I sent the mail to Samsung CEO, I received a call from the person who has been delaying my issue. with the report that it is mishandling and we cannot resolve it. we have to sent it forward to management. from 28th of July today is 6th of July and the samsung M#) is lying on the desk just as a useless brick.SO.... Don't Buy. Customer support should be priority even if you are a big company with phone banging(literal explosions case of galaxy note 7) everywhere.

Good looking fone nice display asusual from Samsung I loved Samsung phone but now since they start using there exynos processors in there fones there phones have become a crap..till note 2 everything was fine..but after note 2 I bought  j7 2016 it had network issues  then finally I sold it for peanuts..then I didn't buy Samsung for a year I used other brands and was happy with there performance..but as I said I always  liked Samsung Mobile..so I thought to give one more try to newly launched Samsung m30 I bought it on first day sale..but to shock me it had same networks  issues as I had with j7 2016..very slow internet like 2G speed ..so I was sure its again same exynos processor problem..so called the Amazon cor the same they said technician ll visit to check the phone and technician said the same this phone had hardware problems. It's just I know coz of exynos processor..now they are going to replace it with new one but I have no trust that even second replaced phone ll be working well...as it ll have same issue coz of exynos  processor what to do can't get refund..so only can think of I ll have better luck with replaced samsm30..pray for me..speaker quality is cranky worst than an ordinary mobile fone microphone quality is also very poor to the surprise no headphones in the box.. I must admit  display is awesome...

Hi,I purchased Samsung Mobile M30 from Amazon on april-2019. Since then i didn't mishandled or any impact on phone even no direct contact to any type of liquid or water . On oct-2020 , i found small purple spot on its left hand side on bottom and then its increasing as time passes  and its appeared dark purple and bluish in color . Hence today i visited to your service centre to show the display and issue  with mobile. After physical inspection of device the service centre guy said that its having liquid inside due to which this problem arose. So they said its chargable becaus eits not come under warranty . So i denied to do repair and take the phone back because i am not satisfied with service centre solution . I didnt do any wrong thing with device and only one year we used the device and problem arise .  no any physical contact of any loquid or water to mobile then how it was happened i dont know . It may be a device fault but Service centre guy not agree with my comments . It may be happened due to moisture i dont know its not our fault then why i have to pay ? Its really frustration to me so please request you  to take appropriate decision and provide the replacement for device or free of cost repair . We all going through a tough situation and i put my hard saving to buy this product and again i have to pay 4 to 5K its not justice to  us .Finally i check all the information regarding Samsung product and service delivery over internet and i found that  most of devices having such issues and lot of complaints placed by consumer against same issue .Within a year such problem arises in Samsung device its really bad to its reputation.Mainly this issue happened in A50 an M30S , ME and J7 samsung products so please check with your technical team what is technical issue with product .

Quality of Camera was the claim of the company for this model. However, Camera of the cell phone all of a sudden stopped working after two years. Tried to repair through Samsung service centre. But no use other than paying money to the repair centre. Had to buy another mobile as without camera not even UPI payments are not possible.  Wasted money for this model.

It went offf with three months of usage now its not working. Worst phone. How to service. I took the phone  to  service centre and they told me mother board issue and got repaired it in warranty and they agreed every m series phone is designed in same way so it gets failed repeatedly without any problem from end user it goes off automatically and so plz take the extended warranty worth 1200rs and i took it. Again in a month again the phone went off the same way with flashy image and cracks on internal side of display and this time they took 4230 rs for repair claiming it internal cracks due to physical damage ( this time also i.ve done nothing like it hasn't fallen down from my hands and even no external force applied by me on phone..) still i paid a lot of money till now. Again in the month of october exactly 6 months after my phone purchase the same issue internal cracks of display and phone went off again they are asking me to pay 4230rs  as it wont cover this issue in warranty. When i asked for how many times should i pay to service agent of authorised service center they claim that we are no where concerned about this problem if you need phone you should pay otherwise buy a new phone. After so much of discussion they agreed this is a failed version so we are providing m30s series free screen replacement twice option this issue is happened because of manufacturing failure but we can't provide free service. If you need phone pay 4230 rs or go for consumer forum we are not concerned about it becauae every m series phones are designed in the same way and we won't agree its our manufacturing problem because we don't want to pay customer back. They even agreed these m series phones are all failed pieces of galaxy s8, s9 and s10. We are just recycling them and selling for low cost so that user might use such high end phone for low amount and quality doesn't matter in such amount so people can't do anything. So consumers plz don't buy this m series and get trapped like me. This samsung is cheaters. Tc

I bought this mobile and it stopped working exactly after 1 yr completion and it's a motherboard issue. This complaint I found in most of M series phone either at local repair shop or samsung service center and cost of repair is more than hlf of mobile price. Samsung is total pathetic in after sale support for their such type of issue, as company should take ownership of such complaints when received in bulk. Atleast please dont buy M series phone. Total waste of money. One yr which also it worked bt it was not that amazing experience.

Unboxed the item and tried to play ringtone or any song to check Audio quality. External speaker is not working . Performed Soft reset and Hard reset both. Now the device become abnormal state during booting stage and  is rebooting automatically for more than 30 mins by showing ""SAMSUNG GALAXY M30"" nothing given over control to move forward...Hold power button on time to control above situation but no use. Is started working like as Un programmed ROBOT.Not at all expected from SAMSUNG.!!!!!!!!!!!!!Are you guys are checking\testing products properly before dispatching to the customers ?? (or) for flash sale sake running behind ???? thinking like Let first deliver and make money, later on will respond to the customers if they face any problem with the defective piece. .Irony is for this product especially, customer will not get an option to select replacement or refund option . You have to be dependent on customer care executive for any further support.You will not come to know the status immediately though executive raised a request for Replacement. It take some time to reflect in the system to update after going through several approvals process. I.e replacement / Refund is not hassle free process.

I received a defective Samsung Galaxy M30 from Amazon. When I am trying to turn on , it boots to the logo then goes to the ""Samsung M30 powered by Android "" screen, then it stays there. I've tried to do a hard reset by holding down the power button and the volume up button and have done reboot and still gets hung on the ""SAMSUNG M30 "" logo. I contact customer services of amazon but they also failed and arranged a Technician visit. After 2 days, Technician agent verify the mobile and reported to Amazon about this problem. After that amazon send a replacement unit to my address. Amazon transport service agent come my address and say that after verification mobile will be replace. Agent trying to turn on the device to get IMEI no. How is this possible? Phone already dead/hung at samsung logo. Agent said that if he saw IMEI number on mobile screen, then replacement will done. I contact customer services about this matter but no solution. Replacement is rejected by amazon transport agent . I saw order details in my amazon app, it shows replacement unit rejected by customer 🙄. I surprised about the service provided by amazon. There is no connection between amazon customer support, Amazon Transport agent, amazon app but managed Amazon india😆😆. All unit are managed by amazon but there is no connection and understanding between them. I think for mobiles flipkart is best and services provided by them is also great. Please do not purchase mobile phones from Amazon. Services provided by amazon is really worst. For this reason 95% of new Mobile phone lunched on flipkart. When purchase mobile phones on Amazon, think twice.

Ok phone.. 9000 enough but not worth of 11999.. processor is 1.8 it frequently lagging..
","
It's been 2 weeks since I'm using the m30 4/64 phone. While on the outside the phone looks stunning and the display is ever glowing eye catching the phone is nothing but disappointing when it comes to performance. The face recognition is slow and below average at best but the fi gerprint sensor makes up for it. Due to the notch display and the huge screen you will end up touching the phone where you never meant to. The camera is decent with comparison to current standards.The processor is its biggest weakness. The phone is noticeably slow for medium yo heavy users. While the Ram is 4gb it doesn't reflect on the performance. Games like PUBG hang and move very slow with an infuriating lag. I stopped playing pubg since I got this phone. The battery capacity is huge. 5000mah. It will easily last you a day (18) hours but on the flip side it takes that much longer get for it to charge.The software is unreliable. The phone stopped taking network by the end of first week in use. I have already been to the service center twice.The screen sometimes goes blank when you're watching a video and turn the phone horizontally. The lock button is way too sensitive so you will end up accidentally locking and unlocking often. As far as image stabilization after zoom is concerned,iPhone 6 beats it even today and I'm saying this out of experience not on a speculative whim.In conclusion,while the phone is cheap for its specifications it does not match up to Samsung's brand name. There are much better phones out there with better performance at possibly a cheaper rate.

I wont recommend you, unless you are looking for a phone from samsung under 15k.

After using this phone for a week, here is what I can say:Pros:1. Display - FHD+, sAMOLED, with always-on display.2. RAM and ROM - 6GB and 128 GB, install all the apps you want.3. Dedicated SIM and Micro SD slots4. Rear Cameras - Triple cam setup with wide angle lens and f1.9 aperture lens for low light  situations.5. Ginormous battery - 5000 mAh. 'Nuff said.6. USB type C - Hassle free insertion of jack into port.7. Latest Android Security Patch February 01, 2019 out of the box.8. Simple and customizable UI - For the first time in years, I did not feel the need to install Nova launcher.9.  Freakin' Headphone Jack!Cons:1. Glossy Plastic Body is a Fingerprint Magnet. Gets Smudged within few minutes of use.2. That Unholy Notch! Turning the notch off shifts the entire notification bar downwards instead of blacking out the notch sides and keeping the notification icons at the same place, reducing the screen space in the process.3. Fast charging?? Not so fast I must say. Phones Supporting Qualcomm QC4.0 charge much faster.4. Exynos 7904. Although uses same 14nm FinFat process as the SD660 SoC, It is quite behind the Snapdragon chipset. The SD660 SoC has 4 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores, the Exynos has only 2 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores. Also the Adreno 512 GPU in the SD is leaps ahead the Exynos' Mali G71 GPU.5. Bluetooth 4.2 only. No BT 5.0.6. USB Type C runs only at USB 2.0 speeds. No support for USB 3.0/3.1.7. Front Camera Low light performance is not great.8. No stereo speakers. Only one bottom firing speaker is present and its not great.9. Network strength is low compared to my other phones, Often dropping me out of VoLTE and 4G.. Again this issue is with the Exynos 7904 SoC. Their modems are just not powerful enough.10. Heats up quite quickly during games.Conclusion:Go for any other mid range phone from any of the brands of BBK Electronics China (oppo, Vivo, or realme, and Yes, all of them including OnePlus are the same company), mi Note (whatever variant number they are on currently) or ASUS Max Pro series. Many of them use SD636/660 SoC, They are better Value for Money than anything Samsung puts out in Indian Market. I'd also say that not including an earphone in the box is a con, but then, others are doing the same thing.

High Noise and heating problem

I have many complaints1) It's (m30)marketed as exynos 7904 processor but , I got a unit with exynos 7885 processor . This is main cheating .2)There is no light sensor , (I know front camera act as light sensor) but it's speed is pathetic I have adjust brightness every time . Shame for device of 15000 Rs cost .3)Even after taking calls screen will not lit up automatically I have to manually do it(because of lack of light sensor and poor quality of proximity sensor ).4) Speaker volume is not good (compare to old Samsung feature phones) and sound cracks more often . Head phone volume is low and it's not having good quality like old Samsung phones .5)Ultra wide angle camera quality is waste it's 5mp wide angle so no details in pictures at all .6) No native support for using amoled screen as led notification light . Have to use NoLED third party app.7) 13MP main camera fully waste . Pictures taken have short range clarity but doesn't have details of distance objects (remember my old Motorola g4 get more detailed distance shots). I think camera module is not up to the mark (cost cutting ???)8) status bar fonts are very small and no option to add extra icons like internet speed etc , there is no option in setting to increase status bar font .9) data toggle buttons ( between to two Sims ) is not available in notification bar.10) Samsung Galaxy apps always runs in background and collecting your information ,  no option for galaxy apps to stop in background and apply battery optimization. Often ""install galaxy apps "" ad pops up very annoying .11) Even phone colour theme cannot be changed unless you  buy Samsung Galaxy themes12) Exynos processor means to no custom ROM development.13)Fragile screen with no screen protection (dragon tail is there but no good).14) fast charger is total waste , you can't get much charge in short time so no 5 min charge and talk 2 hours like feature .15)  No otg support for laptop hard disc with external case ( even some old phones support other for hard disc).16)No correct size external cases and tempered glass support .

Bad Quality Phone
","
Iam writing the review after usage of 6 months. Initially it looks and performs very well. I started observing issues after 2-3 months of usage. Sometimes I got irritated with fingerprint sensor as it won't work.performance also sucks. Device with 6GB of Ram and powerful processor sucks to load a single application. It stuck very frequently. After restart of phone we can see abnormal behaviour of device. It won't allow to enter password sometimes.only good thing is better battery life and display.Edit : after 1+ years of usageUp to one year the mobile is pretty good with minor issues. Best thing I liked is battery backup.After 1.2 years suddenly someday I observed mobile is not getting g charged with the original charger given by samsung. Initially I though charger might not be working but same charger working with other devices. I tried with other fast chargers but no luck.I am in assumption that charging slot might be damaged but I can see it's getting charged with non fast charge support chargers and cable charging with laptop.its so irritating takes 10-12 hours to dull charge. I searched in Google and did all recovery planes no output.There are tons of samsung users are facing the same issue. Yet no replay/software update from samsung. Finally I decided to throw the mobile in dust bin and buy new one.If I r short time user *max 1.5 years) go aheadElse think twice before buying samsung mobile at MID range

Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint if stretching your budget a bit for Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50
","
I'm sharing some of the issues I faced with this phone and some good things too, which might be useful for other users to decide whether they should buy it or not.*Hardware:1. Fully Plastic body feels cheap2. Fingerprint works 3 out of 5 times and is remarkably slow (without vibration motor, so you wouldn't know whether it unlocked or not without looking into screen)3. Super-Amoled display is amazing4. Speaker is avarage5. Screen has no protection (easily gets scratches)6. Battery backup is superb (depends on your uses)7. Camera is strictly avarage8. Processor is just good (expected better)9. Charging takes almost 2.5 hr to bring it from 0% to 100% (still called fast charging?)10. Network reception is very poor (you get very low internet speed)*Software:1. It takes approx 30-40 seconds to turn the phone on2. No good themes or wallpapers are free, you need to buy them 😷. See the screenshots I have attached (MiUi is far better)3. You can't take screenshots or turn the screen off from notification panel (options aren't present, use hardware keys or activate assistant menu)Also, you can't take long screenshots or edit them directly after taking (no doodling option is present in gallery app)Verdict: A lot of phones are present in market with far better specs. Buy it only if you're a die hard fan of Samsung.

Decent smartphone in the price range.

i am going to give critical review.Pros1. Samoled display. Amazing. 20 % more attractive than ipc displays2. Battery is good. With 50 percent u can use for 7 hrs with watching 2movies in the gap3. Front cam is nice. Rear cam is poor. Not  worth4. Dolby atmos... though not really the case coz compared this to s9 of my friend.. s9 sounded real dolby not m30 that too can switched on when u put earphones on.. nonetheless volume will be bit louder if u turn it onCons1.  Frequently it lags. Experienced that trouble in chrome. So 1.8ghz lrocessor not enough go for 2.3 processor.2. User interface is not that good.3. Too many inbuilt samsung apps and google apps. Also no INBUILT APP LOCK this becomes a trouble when u want to install applock app.. if some one uninstall ur app then no security..  only inbuilt app can provide this facility3. MOVING FILES FROM INT MEM TO SD CARD IT TAKING TOO MUCH TIME.  Irritates me4. No vibration sensor. Also if u lock the phone and try fingerprint it should stay on display but it wont show display if u put wrong finger.5. Earphones should have been given. Conclusion  Not worth for 11999 but worth for 9000 only.. processor matters lot. So go for m30s... or like vivo z1 pro..

New generation phone at affordable price

Pros:1. Display quite smooth and pleasing.2. Don't think about polycarbonate body, build is good.3. Batery backup as compare to 5k is ok.Corns:1. Don't get puzzled by youtube review, camera is just ok as it include AI, pixel is not clear but for social media it will do the job.2. Design i think samsung followed the trend and other brand. My first notch display phone, thought it's gonna be ok, but trust me it looks really odd.3. Speaker sound quality not good, not a bit loud, just a cheap sound like low budget phone.4. Main thing where it comes to PUBG? You wont enjoy the gaming with the frame drop in balanced mode with medium frame rate. Lag is effective , lol the design is poor they have kept the speakar gaap in the bottom side so u will face interruption while gaming, the grip won't go easy as it have headphone jack also in the bottom- left. Which will definitely make u feel odd while gaming in loudspeaker or headphone. Even after 7days of use it has started to lag in basic/normal graphics with medium fram rate.I am a Samsung lover, where as i won't recommend you to waste money on this brand. They don't deserve the frame anymore.Only thing i have now is regret after purchase M30.

It's good but I HATE IT

I thought, Samsung is back with good phones and hence I tried it once again. Samsung is bad choice forever for me. I decided, will never buy Samsung phones in future.I received phone and noticed two major issues with this phone1. It heats up a lot when I travel. Of course, in AC room it will not heated up.2. Noise. So there is no voice clarityI booked return request then I came to know that this phone will not be returned but will be replaced. They inspected this phone and declared that it isn't  any fault in this phoneThey send a so called technical expert at my home. He told me that due to notch, there is not much space to adjust the speaker and mic hence in this model, you will find same voice or noise. For him, it is normal.Regarding heating issue, he told me that upto 46degree you can use it and it will be automatically switched off when it will reach up to 46degree. This phone heated up to 41 to 43 degree after few hours of normal internet use.I used to have Redmi note 3S. It was better than this mobile.I am suffering with this mobile without any help and support from Amazon and Samsung

Not upto Samsung Brand value

I made a mistake buying this mobile. So many told me not to buy Samsung mobile for its slowness and network issues, still I went ahead and bought it thinking by now Samsung quality would have bettered but nope. So many issues! First the mobile box had tampered, it looked like very old stock with dirty box. Then the box had only mobile and charger not even screen guard applied. Mobiles back is so plasticky and such a ugly looking! Only the amoled display is worth looking at. Finger print reader is so bad and slow, it takes a while to unlock or react. You doubt whether you properly kept the finger or not.Is been 10 days and phone is ashtray slow. Screen gets hung when some app is open and you get a call. Also, it gets hung when you get a call and try to silence it by pressing start button. Sometimes you feel even touch isn't working but it's because the app reaction is slow in this mobile.Good things I liked are amoled display, dark mode, customizations and some actions given to finger print reader like pulling down navigation bar.

For the extra 2000 bucks, you get an AMOLED screen, better selfies, better connectivity (dual-band Wi-Fi), and a better portrait mode for the rear camera.When compared to the new and emerging competition like Redmi Note 7 Pro, the Galaxy M30 has its advantages (AMOLED display, HD streaming, software, battery, fast charging) and let downs (performance, primary rear camera, plastic body), but it should still largely bank on the Samsung brand value to win the bout. The Note 7 Pro leads in several key aspects.If you are not much into high-end gaming, would value display quality over the camera performance, and are restricted by a budget, the Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint. You could also look into stretching your budget a bit for Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50.*Pros*Excellent DisplayBattery backupSupports HD streamingDedicated card slotUSB Type-C port and fast charging*Cons*No notification lightNot for heavy gamingNo case cover in the boxplastic buildNote:-  no headphone, back cover, screen guard available in box only charger and sim ejector tool is their

If you are thinking about a good budget device then, Go For It.I've used this device for 7 months, in order to know about it current opinion, scroll down.Pros:-1. 5000 MAh Battery capacity!!2. Triple rear Camera.3. 16 MP front camera.4. Full Screen (Notch) Display.5. Super Amoled Display (gives the best colours possible)6. Affordable!Cons:-1. It has Exynos processor for some reasons so you won't get to play very high graphics games very smoothly like you used to with sanpdragon...2. Dosenot have a Metal Body which would have made it more scratch resistant...3. I've heard that its face lock feature isn't that good but I haven't faces any issues with it so far...Edit 1: After using it for a month, mobile suddenly was unable to charge, had to replace the charging port. And you will get a lot of scratches so, a cover is highly recommended!Edit 2: Was Working Good for first 6 months but now, there are quiet a lot of issues like1. Can't use Internet through WiFi.2. Unresponsive incoming call interface.3. Fingerprint sensor barely works.4. Heating problem while charging.5. Weak processor, hence device struggles a lot getting some tasks done.6. Service Center cannot help me with any of these issues... 😐So, here's my final conclusion. If you are laughing to use it for only 5-6 months, it's a biut deal. This device is not for a long run.

Good Camera and Display, Processor not so much

Awasome phone with awasome specification, but i personaly feels phone's big screen sometime difficult to use.Detail review and why I gave 3 start reasons are as follow:Cons first:1. It started heating after 2 months of use that too I am not using it very roughly. In total 24 hours of day i am using it not more than 2 hours (including everything).2. Battery start draining fast compare to initial days. During initial days with the same usage it is used to last for two and half days but now it is lasting not more than one and half day.3. Started hanging up (stopped working). Specially while using camera.4. Camera quality is not as per expectation. Front cemera is okay but rear cemeras not able to capture things in detail. If you click a photo with rear camera and zoom it, the image will start tearing and blurring. Not very effective for students those who are rely on photos for their studies. Its personal experience.5. Fingerprint sensor is little bit slow. It takes 1 or 1.5 seconds to respond.Pros:1. Good and stylish looking phone.2. Adaptive display feature is awasome. No need to change the brightness setting while moving from dark to under sun light or vice versa, it adjust automatically.3. Good torch with adjustable brightness.4. Good sound clearity.I wish most of the cons will be eliminated with software update.And i wish this review will be helpful to the needed one.

A few months after I bought it, the camera stopped working, went to the service centre, they did smthg and sent me back home saying  ""it's good now"" even when I told them to do more thorough checks. Well, I was right and had to go back a couple of days again and had to leave it there because the camera software was apparently damaged ir smthg. After two years  now it's the same problem. It's a good phone, even the camera quality is good. The speakers are ok. But this thing is literally making me want to break it

Don't regret buying this phone one bit

Average phone... you're better off with an Asus or a moto.. the UI is very inconvenient.. takes a lot of getting used to.. even then using the phone is an annoyance rather than second nature.The screen is super bright so that's a plus . And the battery backup is very very good... if it was a more sturdy build would have served a better purpose as a work phone coz you don't have to ask anyone for a damn charger.That stupid pin with which you take the sim slot out should be banned for all phones. Could have had some other mechanism or at least give me a place to keep it..The colour reproduction is okay... seems a bit washed out.Random bugs and lags especially during basic functions like calls... very very annoying.Finally the biggest drawback... the touch accuracy is down the drain... I have to touch min 5 times to pause a damn video... it's a nightmare if I want to skip ahead.So if you need a phone maybe just to call and basic WhatsApp then this is the guy .. doesn't look too shabby... performs alright.. battery is awesomeness.But if you want a little more out of your phone.. just go to the other 5000 mah battery ones.Only reason I got this phone was for the fast charging 5000 mah battery which I wasn't  getting anywhere else.

Received it today.firstly the screen and display is great but the polycarbonate body looks real cheap for this price range.Checked through the settings and apps.well you will not find any lag for now.I believe thats same for all smart phones at this range.Guys dont go for this phone if you are camera savvy, its not the right deal. Although its usp is triple rear camera but its not just that good enough.Wide angle is superb but colour correction and AI control is no atall upto the mark. Note 7 pro, samsung j30 will be ranked way above these model.Front camera is ok and take decent photos.there is a pro mode in camera but not much manual option to p;lay with other that iso and exposure control.Video mode has literally no features.just point and shoot.Atleast expected slowmo and time lapse is 15k budget phone.Battery is good and fast 15w charger was in the package.

A perfect phone at a practical price!

The plus point of this phone is the display, ultra wide camera and the battery life. If you're someone who takes a lot of photos, and consumes a lot of media on there device then this phone is for you.Pros:-sAMOLED Display-Ultra Wide Lens-Battery LifeCons-Slower Processor-Software (Samsung Experience 9.5 looks dated design wise)-Plastic BodyPersonally I haven't noticed much difference in using the AMOLED Display but this might change with time. One thing you might need to keep in mind (I found out about this a little too late) is the processor is closed source so third party ROMs development might not be there. They should have shipped it with Android P and the one UI which is more polished. If you want a phone for camera and media consumption then buy the M30, otherwise if you want a durable phone with better android experience and processor get the Moto One Power.EDIT: After a week of usage I do not find the camera upto the mark, Images lack sharpness and they look a grainy when zoomed in even a bit. This was a huge let down as I expected this phone to have a better camera.

Samsung M30 - a sleek monster

This age samsung phones are nothing, when it comes to feel and user experience. The time the phone was first unboxed, the touch felt hard,but worked without error. Everything else good, camera clearer and real like, clearer than redmi phones, amoled also was ok, definitely amoled, but not very bright and colorful display. The back of phone also was over heating,I called up customer service, they said install all updates, it might change . But even after that, overheating is showing in the processor side and full screen ,when one game starts. The touch problem could not be solved completely, as this was not a appreciable error ,but only weak response and hard touch. I never felt like playing any game with such a touch and poor power behind the handset. Tried all touch repair apps from play store, and reset the phone also, but this never comes to a new phone touch feel. Terrible experience!! Even many China phones do more justice to everything. Samsung phones are only a name sake top notch.

I've never invested more than 8k for the two  smartphones I've used. I'm also not a guy who repeatedly keeps changing phones. So when my previous phone started giving me minor issues, felt it was the right time to buy a new one and upon being suggested by my friend, choose the Samsung m30, 6Gb Ram, 128 Gb variant. It's almost been 3 months since I bought this phone. It's pretty much like all Samsung phones filled with a wide range of applications, user friendly UI etc coupled with few new features.Pros.1. Good camera- Front camera in particular is very good. Also the wide angle rear camera helps you to capture a wider picture.2. Battery- Never ever did I think a smartphone would give a 24hr battery backup. I extensively use my phone for social media apps, netflix, Amazon prime etc but the battery life the phone has got is amazing. You won't even need a powerbank. You also get a fast charger which takes roughly 90 min for one full charge.3. Lockscreen stories- This feature is something new I've come across but nonetheless, is pretty amazing. Helps you keep upto date with the current affairs stories you are interested in while the screen is locked.4. Dolby atmos- Gives you a much better sound experience when using a headset. It is also categorised for various age groups and type of usage such as music, movies etc.Cons.1. Fingerprint sensor - It has been an issue as it doesn't detect your fingerprints sometimes.2. Ringtone- Not sure whether the feature is same for all Samsung phones, but the ringtone automatically increases and decreases. From what I've read across the internet, I've come to know that it is a feature that works based on the surroundings you/the phone is in.All in all, the phone is a decent buy for the price. Suggested for people whose usage is a lot and don't want their battery to drain quickly.

Got this phone around a month ago. My earlier phone was moto g5s plus. I am a moderate user of phone who keeps on hanging with internet and all the required essential  apps, I also  play games at times.Now what good about m 30 for me is:1. Premium  software quality with no ads.2. Excellent display.3. Better performance  compared to my moto phone. This was where I surprised even though on papers this phone has not very powerful processors but still it gives it's best when comes to background  app management. I have not felt any heating issues or lag issues even after using heavy apps for hours!4. Good front camera.5. Excellent  battery  life . Comes around 2.5 days for me.Some cons:1. Even though primary camera is good. But does not give it's best in low light.2. Yes its software is premium with ad free but i was expecting Samsung UI 1 which is available  in A series.3. Speaker could have been amplified more.Overall a very practical  phone which gives u a premium  feel especially  due to its display.Many people compare this with redmi note 7 pro. I agree note 7 pro is a good phone which has better processor but you cannot feel the same premium experience as m 30 here is why:1. Just compare the both display!2. Check out note 7 apps filled with full ads.3. Even though they claim 48 mp it's not always! it it gives u in pro mode with no zoom option.4 microphone and headset audio of m 30 is better.5. Note 7 is a perfect phone for teen agers who is more intrested in gaming or heavy usage. M 30 is for professional  and moderate  users who are more intrested in quality for primary usage of phone.

Samsung M30 is an excellent value for money. At the price range, it offers competent configurations. I have been using it for over a month and here are my reviews:Over all performance: Satisfactory. Though I bought the 6GB variant, there is no comparable improvement in performance when compared to a 3 GB variant. That being said, I have not observed significant delay in boot time of apps and concurrent background apps continue from the last session rather than re-launching.Camera: I am slightly unhappy with the 13MP primary camera. With the other configurations being competitive, a 13 MP primary camera seems amateurish. The picture quality retains the standard and with ambient light, pictures are of good quality. The 16 MP front camera is impressive and captures good selfie images. The other features of wide angle lens of primary camera, subject focus of both front and rear camera are also impressive and lives up to the expectation.Battery: The 5000 mAh battery is quite a mammoth. Do not expect it to last 2 days though. The idea is that with a good screen use throughout the day, there will still be some juice left in the battery to last the night. This seems reasonable battery backup before charging it up again.Media: The display and video effects are quite good. The DolbyAtmos needs a special mention which gives a notch to the audio experience when an ear phone is plugged in.OS: I received Oxygen in the boxed set and was a big disappointed. But Samsung released Pie with One UI within a month and this elated my mood.Overall its a very good smart phone to use at this price point. It would have been a nice though to include a silicone back cover and a screen guard in the box.If brand is of importance to you, then Samsung M30 will be worthy choice for you to consider.

AN EXCELLENT OPTION -VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY

First, i don't play game.Second, my primary purpose of buying this phone is watching web series and movies through Amazon Prime Videos and doind daily  normal uses.In Highest quality there is a option to download videos through prime videos is 1.8Gb/hr but honestly it will download only lass than 1Gb data in highest quality. The best part is you can play Prime videos in whole screen like which is not able to play in Redmi Note 8, which is also a full hd display phone.In realme 3 pro the maximum download quality option available is 2.3 Gb/hr, so it download better quality videos as compared  to Samsung galaxy M30 or Redmi Note 8.If your purpose is not watching prime videos than go for Redmi 8, yes simply 8, which has the best battery backup i have ever experienced. Lasts for 2 day through intense use.You can't compare the video quality through youtube or a video in your sd card ( videos will look approximately same in all these phones) but when you will start watching online contents (Amazon prime videos,  Netflix  etc) then there will be a major difference between these phones.Samsung M30 Android 10 experience after updates is very smooth. You can uninstall majority of preinstalled apps like Google play music, movies, books etc which you can't do in Redme note 8 and Realme 3 pro. There will be many advertisements in the realme and redme in there pre installed apps which you can't uninstall or even disable,but not in Samsung M30.For daily uses 3gb ram and 32gb memory of m30 is more than enough i didn't experience any lag or hang,works smoothly.

I have been using this mobile for quite some time now and to give a gist I have to say that there are a few compromises made to give consumers some decent specs.Some good stuff,Battery life is amazing.It gives me 1.5 days of power and still there is some 15% mostly remaining. Only 30% is sufficient to drive your day with normal usage of emails, songs and 30 mins of YouTube.Charges fastLittle more than half an hour is sufficient for 45% charge.CameraYou can not underestimate m30 here, it can take some serious photographs, if you do the settings right.DisplayOnly one word, Wow!SafeOther manufacturers in this range are mostly Chinese and everyone is aware that china is known for data theft. I might be wrong on this but anyways I don't trust these brands anymore.3.5 mm Jack not at top.This is a very specific issue, for me this is good because if you have wired earphones, wire handling becomes very easy.Some bads,Fingerprint scannerIt is the slowest I have ever used, although you will get used to it.BodyI have never used this phone without a cover, ever though it has developed big scratches at it's back. They are noticable even from a distance, if I remove the cover.Wide angle lensIt is there for just name sake, it doesn't take good photographs.Overall if you have used your old phone for quite some time and are looking for a phone for next couple of years, I think this is an option worth considering.Please note that I am not a heavy user!

Samsung has really created a masterpiece. I have been using it for the last 10 days. I have used other Samsung phones but this one is something different. Here, I am listing the pros and cons of this mobile phone.Pros -1- The battery is great. 5000 mah battery give you more than a full day backup on moderate use. The power saving mode of Samsung is worth going for. Use it wisely and I guess the juice will not run out for 2 or more days. I have tried that recently while I was traveling.2- Display is awesome. It feels.3- Design is also great. I have the blue one and it looks beautiful. The navigation settings let you make the navigation buttons disappear and you experience a better screen.4- The fast charging works really fast.5- Camera is great. Both front and back. Especially in low light conditions. Flash is awesome. Zoom is also great.6- No Hybrid slot is what I seek in the phones these days. Thus, you are not limited by the storage issue if you are using the dual sim.7- Dual 4g is good. Now, I can use my BSNL 3g and at the same time, my Jio works fine.8- Face recognition and fingerprint unlocking are very fast.9- Touch sensitivity is very much.10- I got 200GB space on One Drive for two years free with this device.Cons -1- The wide angle lens needs some improvement. The picture quality is just OK. But as this is a new experience, I would not say its a major con.2- The placement of earphone is downwards so when you want to use your phone earphone and charger plugged in, it becomes a little difficult to operate.For now, this is my experience, I'll keep updating.

SAMSUNG Galaxy M30 is simply great Phone from SAMSUNG under Rs.15000/-

I have always been a Samsung user and am always appreciating Samsung for their amazing services.I was looking for a new device and I was very head bent on the Samsung M30 the day I saw it.I am using the 4 + 64GB version in blue and it works just so well!!I am very happy with my device and recommend it to everyone looking for something in the price range.The 50000 mAh battery is just so helpful and very rare in mobiles, with normal usage on Wifi I get upto 3 full days of battery backup!And also you can fully charge the phone with the fast charger from 0 to 100 in just 2-3 hrs!The features are just unlimited and the device feels actually premium to use.An added feature of Samsung is that the phone damage can be repaired almost anywhere you are and it won't even cost you much.Plus Samsung is both, durable and reliable, even with the 4GB RAM I can play games with a lot of clarity!The device also doesn't heat up!The screen is vivid and almost every setting can be customized very easily and effectively for every person.The Samsung in-built apps might seem like a burden, but if you turn off the notifications, they're really helpful in gaming and multitasking!I have never experienced any system error in this device, if I have got any, it is due to some error I made, for which I was helped by the Samsung online chat service step by step.Samsung phones also have many many in-built features like antivirus, automatic cache memory cleaner and device booster that improve the performance of the product.With smart view one can connect easily to almost any TV set for screen mirroring. And the camera quality is just so cool! I don't even need to search for wallpapers, I can easily just take out my phone, look for a scene I like and click!Whatever I say is less, this phone is a must buy!The best choice ever!!

I recently bought a Galaxy M30 phone and I am fully satisfied with it. Thanks to the 6GB RAM, there is no perceptible delay in processing any command. Then there is the 128 GB Memory, which is more than a match for the videos which one gets very frequently on WhatsApp groups. The 5000 aAh battery enables it to run for two days without charging. Thanks to the C type charging cable, it gets fully charged in about an hour (earlier, I had to charge my phone each night, but sometimes I ran out of juice by evening).Feature by feature, M30 is better than the J8 I was using earlier, but it cost me less than what I paid for J8 less than a year ago. M30 also compares quite well with the higher priced A50 which my nephew uses - the specifications are nearly identical, but the camera is superior in M30.This phone is described as ""Made for India"" and Samsung seems to have done away with all the frills in terms of packaging - in other words, the box is quite flimsy. Apart from the handset itself, all you get is a data cable, a travel adaptor and an ejection pin - there are no earphones which used to be a standard accessory in earlier models. However, no compromises have been made in the specifications and the manufacturing quality of the phone itself.On the whole, an excellent option for Samsung fans - the latest features and very good value for money too!

The device which I am using is Samsung Galaxy M30 which comes with 6gb RAM and 128gb of storage.Samsung Galaxy M30 is powered by a 1.8GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor that features 2 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and 6 cores clocked at 1.6GHz. It has Mali G71 gpu.Coming to the display it has 6.40-inch infinity U superAMOLED FullHD+ touchscreen and an aspect ratio of 19.5 : 9.The screen has very good viewing angles and looks very punchy.It has that auto brightness option too.Moving on to the camera it has a rear triple camera setup which is a very nice thing.We have 13 MP main camera @ f1.9 + 5MP Wide Angle camera + 5 MP Depth sensing camera.Moving to to the front camera it's a 16MP shooter.It's having a huge 5000 mAh battery which is a good thing for heavy users. We can easily get 10-12. Hrs of screentime in this device.Moving on to the charger it has USB type-C port which is actually a good thing. The charger is a fast charger that is 9 Volts at 1.6 ampere.Coming on to the device it has a polycarbonate back with gradiant colour i.e. at the top it is more bluish and becomes black at the bottom. It actually gives it a premium look and also at the back we have finger unlock sensor.In addition it has a dual SIM slot(both 4G) plus a dedicated micro SD slot also which is a nice thing as well.Its memory is expandable up to 512 gb.The phone has Android oreo 8.1 and Samsung Experience 9.5 UI.It's a good phone with good built quality and I like all the features especially the tripple camera setup. It has that wide angle lens which gives a different perspective and it is a good feature to have on a smartphone. The pictures come out to be good with good colours.The camera does a very good job in low light conditions also.It's a value for money kind of a device!

This Phone is above this world of android phones.""FINGERPRINT READER"" is as good as the eye power of detecting objects in 1/16th of a second.And when I say ""BATTERY LIFE"", you can talk more than 24 hours in single full charge. U can use internet as much as you can by charging once in a day. U can play games, listen to music (YouTube) , video calling and much more u can do. This phone has that much battery life, you will forget when was the last time you charged the phone.U always don't need to bring your charger with you, if you are on a one day outing.And it's FAST CHARGING"" is also amazing, the phone takes approx 40 minutes to full charge.Without using internet, I can guess, u can use the phone for minimum 3/4 days.And one more thing, ULTRA POWER SAVING MODE, after applying this mode u can use the phone for a complete day even in 10% charging and u can use 6-8 Apps in this mode, u can use internet too.And I thinking I don't need to review it's CAMERAS bcoz I have no words to praise the cameras, Such amazing high quality pictures with amazing filters of different colours , u can record videos in very high resolution.When we talk about SCREEN, it has very attractive and colourful screen, when u touch u can feel the smoothness. Pixels of the screen are very good, u can use YouTube upto 4K.And when we talk about RAM and INTERNAL STORAGE u have 4 GB Ram and 64 GB internal storage, you will NEVER face HANG problem.And it is just a overview, there is much much more in this phone, u will never regret buying this phone.I strongly recommend this phone to each and everyone. I'm using it since June , from that day I haven't faced any problem.

Don't buy any Samsung phone with exynos processor..

First of all I would like to inform you that I am writing this review after 2month of purchase of m30 black 4gb ram. This is the best in in mid range of 15k. Phone has got its update i.e. android 9 which is awesome. Phone has super battery performance.once fully charged phone can run up to 2 days in normal usage. Phone is awesome for gaming user but I will recommend them to got with 6gb ram variants. Talking with phone design the front panel is looking sexy,and as well as back.one issue with back panel is that it is very slippery you need to handle it properly if you didn't have back cover.coming with camera quality front 16 megapixel is awesome I can't imagine the picture quality in this range of phone only issue with front camera is low light issues.secondly if we talk about primary camera it's too good.triple camera with wide angle is awesome.even low light is not a big deal.i have posted some pictures for camera quality. Talking about fingerprints it is placed little above so in starting you will face some issues while using it but at later stage it will be okay for you. For charging they had provided type c charger which is very much cool. Full phone will get charged within less than 2hrs reason as battery is 5000 mah so it is taking some time but if you charging for 30 mins also it's enough for 5 to 6 hrs. Only think which I am disappointed is that they didn't provide earphone Talking about overall performance phone is awesome I had used it for 2months and personally I am very much satisfied with phone performance Samsung had done wonderful job in mid segment price range. I would also thank Amazon India which delivers the product within 1 day. If you desire any phone under 15k m30 is best which I will recommend.

I have purchased SAMSUNG Galaxy M30 on 30/04/2019 (delivered on 01/05/2019) and using it for past 4 months. I love all the features and till date there is no complaint from my side.The advantages of SAMSUNG Galaxy M30 according to me are:1. Network - It remains stable most of the time, I use Vodafone and Jio network.2. Body -  It's dimension is 159 x 75.1 x 8.5 mm and weight is just 174 gm, nice and slim to hold in hand.3. Display - Super AMOLED display so no stains to eyes and smooth touch.4. Platform - Android 8.1 (Oreo), upgradable to Android 9.0 (Pie); One UI (My phone is upgraded after 20 days of purchase) and Exynos 7904 octa-core processor never lets the phone slow down.5. Memory - I use 4GB+64 GB device, I can assure no hanging or lagging problem even if you use it for continuous 1-2 hours with several apps running.6. Camera - Triple rear camera (13+5+5 MP) with 16 MP selfie camera is simply awesome.7. Sound - Dolby Atmos sound with active noise cancelation, functioning great.8. Sensors - Fingerprint sensor is rear mounted and believe me till date no issue with the sensor, working pretty smoothly.9. Battery - Li-Po 5000 mAh battery with Fast battery charging 15W, Full charge completes within 1.5 hours if you put charge at 15% battery remaining and trust my according my usage it stays for whole 2 days after normal usage of device.10. Miscellaneous - Wi-Fi 802.11, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS is there, FM Radio with recording, USB 2.0 Type-C with reversible connector and most important SAR of galaxy M30 is 0.41 W/kg (Low radiation)After using it for about 4 months it's all well and simply amazing.Thank you SAMSUNG and AMAZON for making my life awesome.- Nilendu Saha (Kolkata, West Bengal)

Poor quality Item

I bought this for my 2 daughter who had kidnapped my wife's AND my phone everyday and refuses to give it until we threaten them with the police/indian army/indian airforce etc.My married life was going to hell, my wife was irritated and frustrated, she was threatening with divorce. Everyday once we reach home our phones disappears and only appears once our daughters go to school in the morning. I had to check my mails in my laptop instead of my phone which is more convenient as well. Many days I leave office late so that I have my phone in my possession, and this was causing health problems for me.I was on a crucial turining point in my life.Then I saw this AD from Samsung. My life was about to change for ever.I placed order and it was delivered in the same day.And our life was reset. We were back to early days of our daughters who would happily ignore me and my wife's existence and just do thier own stuff without any troubles.Once we bought this phone, we are leading a happy life. Our phones no more disappears, I can leave my phone on a table or sofa and goto toilet and come back with the phone being in the excat same place where I had left it.It was bliss.And I can check my mails in my own phone instead of laptop. My wife has also started loving me again, she dropped the idea of divorcing me.We are only little happy family because of M30.Ah about the phone, its a excellent phone, just go ahead and buy it.

Worst phone gets display cracks automatically without falling down and when in hands
","
Pros:> Display is very cool. On par with flagship phones.> Battery life is great.> Camera quality is fair, comparing it with previous generation samsung phones.> Touch is very smooth. Much smoother than the competition redmi note 7 pro. And also a better display than the same.> fast charger is included in the box!> Widevine L1 certified, so you can watch shows and youtube videos in HD.> really good fast charging. Goes from 10 to 100 percent in 2 hours, and then lasts 2 days with moderate usage. Even a quick 10 minutes charge will help you keep your phone alive for the rest of your day.> triple camera setup with a wide angle lens for great landscape pictures.Cons> processor not powerful enough. Not a good choice for hardcore gamers. But you can play games on low quality.> night camera is okayish. Could have been better.> no 4k video, not even 60fps option in the videos, so there is no slowmo either.> Aspect ratio is a bit odd. Videos are slighty zoomed in on apps. Even instagram stories are slightly zoomed in to fit on screen. There must be a way to change it but I have yet to discover the setting.> No gorilla glass and polycarbonate back. Both sides are prone to scratches.But it if:You are a student and spend a lot of time on phone studying and taking notes.If you want to watch shows online and youtube in good quality.If you want a phone that lasts long (in terms of battery).Don't buy if you want a high-performance phone.Rating: 8/10. The phone is good for its price. You won't get this display at this price in any other phone. The battery and fast charging are a nice addition.

Worst ever

I bought the 6GB+128GB Black variant. First of all, for people who are complaining about unable to play PUBG, FOR GOD'S SAKE INCREASE YOUR BUDGET OR GO FOR OTHER BRANDs. This phone is for people who are looking for a better display, long battery life and Advertisement free OS (sick of Xiaomi).Battery- I get around 8+ hrs of screen ontime with 50% brightness. My phone is connected to Wifi 95% of the time with 2 4G connections running in the background. I have multiple BT devices which were operated through this phone. I have been torrenting, listening to music, watching videos in YT, Netflix, calling for 2+ hrs, texting, trying out new apps etc and still left with 15% battery. Although, fast charger of 15 W is orovided with the phone but I use a 18W MI charger. Now thats a battery😀Screen- Its super Amoled screen, therefore, the video quality is extremy good  The colors are correctly saturated with deep blacks making video watching a pleasant experience. It also comes with L1 Widevine support, so you can stream videos in HD. Overall, a very good display in this budget.OS- Not as good as stock android ( yes I prefer stock android) but comes with a lot of customization which increases the productivity. However, there are no irritating advertisements anywhere in the OS unlike Xiaomi phones.Operation- Smooth so far with good RAM management. I did not face any lag whike using multiple apps. But a few more updates to One UI will be good.Storage- You get 100+ GB free when you boot the phone for the first time and you get a dedicated SD card slot.Camera- I prefer DSLR for photos, however, for casual shots, its ok.

My mail to Samsung CEO will clear up the issue I am facing with samsung. I have also attached images.Hi,This is Rahul Godara, owner of a Samsung Galaxy M30. My phone was showing an issue with moisture in USB port which seemed to be just a software glitch and after waiting for a whole day the phone was not charging with the standard samsung charger but the same charger is working with other Xiaomi Remi Note 7. I called the Samsung customer care. They gave me resolution of either updating the device or take it to the Samsung service centre nearby, which unfortunately was TVS electronics in Dwarka ,Ramphal chowk ,sector-7, New Delhi. As I was not able to take the device with me to the centre my mom went there with the device. It was until now that we did not have an issue with a small scratch on the screen (just below the front camera on the bezel but not on the screen or camera) which was promoted in status by the customer care staff to a “crack” in screen. Any way the device did not have any issues with the screen it was just supposed to be charged and may be updated as suggested by the customer care person. The device was bought on 22nd May 2019 i.e. approximately 1 month before this incident. So, we hoped that we would not have to pay anything as we where there for a software issue. The customer care representative came in with the report that it is a crack in the screen and they cannot fix the screen until they get screen fixed for Rs. 6000 /- then only they will fix any other issues which were covered in the warranty. Once again I had no issues with the screen. They were adamant about the scratch being the crack on the screen and asked to either pay and get the phone fixed or they cannot help us.I called the consumer court help line and registered a complaint ( Docket no. 1413754).I received a call from samsung and have been receiving calls for almost one week. I have sent clear pictures of the scratch and have been very patient with he process being followed. But my patience have been wearing thin as the Samsung executive only calls if there is an update done by me to the consumer helping complaint and asking me to wait and never provides a resolution.Is this the type of service samsung is imparting to its customers these days? I was a user of samsung phone ( galaxy note one ) and was very happy with it. The service and everything but had to leave because of similar issues in the past and now we are here again facing similar issues and with a realisation of making the same mistake again hoping samsung doing something better.I had already submitted details of the device to  the samsung executive by the Dilasini Chaudhary in emails with subjects “Reagrding Samsung Device_3730657670” and “Sending more pictures of the scratch”.The details of the device have been updated on the consumer complaint docket no. 1413754.SM-M305F/DSIMEI:xxxxxx/10/xxxxxx/4IMEI:xxxxxxx/10/xxxxxx1/2S/N: xxxxxxxxxxxxWarm regards,LATEST UPDATE: As soon as I sent the mail to Samsung CEO, I received a call from the person who has been delaying my issue. with the report that it is mishandling and we cannot resolve it. we have to sent it forward to management. from 28th of July today is 6th of July and the samsung M#) is lying on the desk just as a useless brick.SO.... Don't Buy. Customer support should be priority even if you are a big company with phone banging(literal explosions case of galaxy note 7) everywhere.

Worst service by amazon. Please go for Flipkart

Hi,I purchased Samsung Mobile M30 from Amazon on april-2019. Since then i didn't mishandled or any impact on phone even no direct contact to any type of liquid or water . On oct-2020 , i found small purple spot on its left hand side on bottom and then its increasing as time passes  and its appeared dark purple and bluish in color . Hence today i visited to your service centre to show the display and issue  with mobile. After physical inspection of device the service centre guy said that its having liquid inside due to which this problem arose. So they said its chargable becaus eits not come under warranty . So i denied to do repair and take the phone back because i am not satisfied with service centre solution . I didnt do any wrong thing with device and only one year we used the device and problem arise .  no any physical contact of any loquid or water to mobile then how it was happened i dont know . It may be a device fault but Service centre guy not agree with my comments . It may be happened due to moisture i dont know its not our fault then why i have to pay ? Its really frustration to me so please request you  to take appropriate decision and provide the replacement for device or free of cost repair . We all going through a tough situation and i put my hard saving to buy this product and again i have to pay 4 to 5K its not justice to  us .Finally i check all the information regarding Samsung product and service delivery over internet and i found that  most of devices having such issues and lot of complaints placed by consumer against same issue .Within a year such problem arises in Samsung device its really bad to its reputation.Mainly this issue happened in A50 an M30S , ME and J7 samsung products so please check with your technical team what is technical issue with product .

An overrated underperforming phone.

Quality of Camera was the claim of the company for this model. However, Camera of the cell phone all of a sudden stopped working after two years. Tried to repair through Samsung service centre. But no use other than paying money to the repair centre. Had to buy another mobile as without camera not even UPI payments are not possible.  Wasted money for this model.

Average Phone with a high price tag.

It went offf with three months of usage now its not working. Worst phone. How to service. I took the phone  to  service centre and they told me mother board issue and got repaired it in warranty and they agreed every m series phone is designed in same way so it gets failed repeatedly without any problem from end user it goes off automatically and so plz take the extended warranty worth 1200rs and i took it. Again in a month again the phone went off the same way with flashy image and cracks on internal side of display and this time they took 4230 rs for repair claiming it internal cracks due to physical damage ( this time also i.ve done nothing like it hasn't fallen down from my hands and even no external force applied by me on phone..) still i paid a lot of money till now. Again in the month of october exactly 6 months after my phone purchase the same issue internal cracks of display and phone went off again they are asking me to pay 4230rs  as it wont cover this issue in warranty. When i asked for how many times should i pay to service agent of authorised service center they claim that we are no where concerned about this problem if you need phone you should pay otherwise buy a new phone. After so much of discussion they agreed this is a failed version so we are providing m30s series free screen replacement twice option this issue is happened because of manufacturing failure but we can't provide free service. If you need phone pay 4230 rs or go for consumer forum we are not concerned about it becauae every m series phones are designed in the same way and we won't agree its our manufacturing problem because we don't want to pay customer back. They even agreed these m series phones are all failed pieces of galaxy s8, s9 and s10. We are just recycling them and selling for low cost so that user might use such high end phone for low amount and quality doesn't matter in such amount so people can't do anything. So consumers plz don't buy this m series and get trapped like me. This samsung is cheaters. Tc

M30 Cons should know before buying

I bought this mobile and it stopped working exactly after 1 yr completion and it's a motherboard issue. This complaint I found in most of M series phone either at local repair shop or samsung service center and cost of repair is more than hlf of mobile price. Samsung is total pathetic in after sale support for their such type of issue, as company should take ownership of such complaints when received in bulk. Atleast please dont buy M series phone. Total waste of money. One yr which also it worked bt it was not that amazing experience.

Unboxed the item and tried to play ringtone or any song to check Audio quality. External speaker is not working . Performed Soft reset and Hard reset both. Now the device become abnormal state during booting stage and  is rebooting automatically for more than 30 mins by showing ""SAMSUNG GALAXY M30"" nothing given over control to move forward...Hold power button on time to control above situation but no use. Is started working like as Un programmed ROBOT.Not at all expected from SAMSUNG.!!!!!!!!!!!!!Are you guys are checking\testing products properly before dispatching to the customers ?? (or) for flash sale sake running behind ???? thinking like Let first deliver and make money, later on will respond to the customers if they face any problem with the defective piece. .Irony is for this product especially, customer will not get an option to select replacement or refund option . You have to be dependent on customer care executive for any further support.You will not come to know the status immediately though executive raised a request for Replacement. It take some time to reflect in the system to update after going through several approvals process. I.e replacement / Refund is not hassle free process.

Once again Samsung?

I received a defective Samsung Galaxy M30 from Amazon. When I am trying to turn on , it boots to the logo then goes to the ""Samsung M30 powered by Android "" screen, then it stays there. I've tried to do a hard reset by holding down the power button and the volume up button and have done reboot and still gets hung on the ""SAMSUNG M30 "" logo. I contact customer services of amazon but they also failed and arranged a Technician visit. After 2 days, Technician agent verify the mobile and reported to Amazon about this problem. After that amazon send a replacement unit to my address. Amazon transport service agent come my address and say that after verification mobile will be replace. Agent trying to turn on the device to get IMEI no. How is this possible? Phone already dead/hung at samsung logo. Agent said that if he saw IMEI number on mobile screen, then replacement will done. I contact customer services about this matter but no solution. Replacement is rejected by amazon transport agent . I saw order details in my amazon app, it shows replacement unit rejected by customer 🙄. I surprised about the service provided by amazon. There is no connection between amazon customer support, Amazon Transport agent, amazon app but managed Amazon india😆😆. All unit are managed by amazon but there is no connection and understanding between them. I think for mobiles flipkart is best and services provided by them is also great. Please do not purchase mobile phones from Amazon. Services provided by amazon is really worst. For this reason 95% of new Mobile phone lunched on flipkart. When purchase mobile phones on Amazon, think twice.

Ok phone.. 9000 enough but not worth of 11999.. processor is 1.8 it frequently lagging..
","
It's been 2 weeks since I'm using the m30 4/64 phone. While on the outside the phone looks stunning and the display is ever glowing eye catching the phone is nothing but disappointing when it comes to performance. The face recognition is slow and below average at best but the fi gerprint sensor makes up for it. Due to the notch display and the huge screen you will end up touching the phone where you never meant to. The camera is decent with comparison to current standards.The processor is its biggest weakness. The phone is noticeably slow for medium yo heavy users. While the Ram is 4gb it doesn't reflect on the performance. Games like PUBG hang and move very slow with an infuriating lag. I stopped playing pubg since I got this phone. The battery capacity is huge. 5000mah. It will easily last you a day (18) hours but on the flip side it takes that much longer get for it to charge.The software is unreliable. The phone stopped taking network by the end of first week in use. I have already been to the service center twice.The screen sometimes goes blank when you're watching a video and turn the phone horizontally. The lock button is way too sensitive so you will end up accidentally locking and unlocking often. As far as image stabilization after zoom is concerned,iPhone 6 beats it even today and I'm saying this out of experience not on a speculative whim.In conclusion,while the phone is cheap for its specifications it does not match up to Samsung's brand name. There are much better phones out there with better performance at possibly a cheaper rate.

I wont recommend you, unless you are looking for a phone from samsung under 15k.

After using this phone for a week, here is what I can say:Pros:1. Display - FHD+, sAMOLED, with always-on display.2. RAM and ROM - 6GB and 128 GB, install all the apps you want.3. Dedicated SIM and Micro SD slots4. Rear Cameras - Triple cam setup with wide angle lens and f1.9 aperture lens for low light  situations.5. Ginormous battery - 5000 mAh. 'Nuff said.6. USB type C - Hassle free insertion of jack into port.7. Latest Android Security Patch February 01, 2019 out of the box.8. Simple and customizable UI - For the first time in years, I did not feel the need to install Nova launcher.9.  Freakin' Headphone Jack!Cons:1. Glossy Plastic Body is a Fingerprint Magnet. Gets Smudged within few minutes of use.2. That Unholy Notch! Turning the notch off shifts the entire notification bar downwards instead of blacking out the notch sides and keeping the notification icons at the same place, reducing the screen space in the process.3. Fast charging?? Not so fast I must say. Phones Supporting Qualcomm QC4.0 charge much faster.4. Exynos 7904. Although uses same 14nm FinFat process as the SD660 SoC, It is quite behind the Snapdragon chipset. The SD660 SoC has 4 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores, the Exynos has only 2 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores. Also the Adreno 512 GPU in the SD is leaps ahead the Exynos' Mali G71 GPU.5. Bluetooth 4.2 only. No BT 5.0.6. USB Type C runs only at USB 2.0 speeds. No support for USB 3.0/3.1.7. Front Camera Low light performance is not great.8. No stereo speakers. Only one bottom firing speaker is present and its not great.9. Network strength is low compared to my other phones, Often dropping me out of VoLTE and 4G.. Again this issue is with the Exynos 7904 SoC. Their modems are just not powerful enough.10. Heats up quite quickly during games.Conclusion:Go for any other mid range phone from any of the brands of BBK Electronics China (oppo, Vivo, or realme, and Yes, all of them including OnePlus are the same company), mi Note (whatever variant number they are on currently) or ASUS Max Pro series. Many of them use SD636/660 SoC, They are better Value for Money than anything Samsung puts out in Indian Market. I'd also say that not including an earphone in the box is a con, but then, others are doing the same thing.

High Noise and heating problem
","
I have many complaints1) It's (m30)marketed as exynos 7904 processor but , I got a unit with exynos 7885 processor . This is main cheating .2)There is no light sensor , (I know front camera act as light sensor) but it's speed is pathetic I have adjust brightness every time . Shame for device of 15000 Rs cost .3)Even after taking calls screen will not lit up automatically I have to manually do it(because of lack of light sensor and poor quality of proximity sensor ).4) Speaker volume is not good (compare to old Samsung feature phones) and sound cracks more often . Head phone volume is low and it's not having good quality like old Samsung phones .5)Ultra wide angle camera quality is waste it's 5mp wide angle so no details in pictures at all .6) No native support for using amoled screen as led notification light . Have to use NoLED third party app.7) 13MP main camera fully waste . Pictures taken have short range clarity but doesn't have details of distance objects (remember my old Motorola g4 get more detailed distance shots). I think camera module is not up to the mark (cost cutting ???)8) status bar fonts are very small and no option to add extra icons like internet speed etc , there is no option in setting to increase status bar font .9) data toggle buttons ( between to two Sims ) is not available in notification bar.10) Samsung Galaxy apps always runs in background and collecting your information ,  no option for galaxy apps to stop in background and apply battery optimization. Often ""install galaxy apps "" ad pops up very annoying .11) Even phone colour theme cannot be changed unless you  buy Samsung Galaxy themes12) Exynos processor means to no custom ROM development.13)Fragile screen with no screen protection (dragon tail is there but no good).14) fast charger is total waste , you can't get much charge in short time so no 5 min charge and talk 2 hours like feature .15)  No otg support for laptop hard disc with external case ( even some old phones support other for hard disc).16)No correct size external cases and tempered glass support .

Bad Quality Phone
","
Iam writing the review after usage of 6 months. Initially it looks and performs very well. I started observing issues after 2-3 months of usage. Sometimes I got irritated with fingerprint sensor as it won't work.performance also sucks. Device with 6GB of Ram and powerful processor sucks to load a single application. It stuck very frequently. After restart of phone we can see abnormal behaviour of device. It won't allow to enter password sometimes.only good thing is better battery life and display.Edit : after 1+ years of usageUp to one year the mobile is pretty good with minor issues. Best thing I liked is battery backup.After 1.2 years suddenly someday I observed mobile is not getting g charged with the original charger given by samsung. Initially I though charger might not be working but same charger working with other devices. I tried with other fast chargers but no luck.I am in assumption that charging slot might be damaged but I can see it's getting charged with non fast charge support chargers and cable charging with laptop.its so irritating takes 10-12 hours to dull charge. I searched in Google and did all recovery planes no output.There are tons of samsung users are facing the same issue. Yet no replay/software update from samsung. Finally I decided to throw the mobile in dust bin and buy new one.If I r short time user *max 1.5 years) go aheadElse think twice before buying samsung mobile at MID range

Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint if stretching your budget a bit for Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50
","
I'm sharing some of the issues I faced with this phone and some good things too, which might be useful for other users to decide whether they should buy it or not.*Hardware:1. Fully Plastic body feels cheap2. Fingerprint works 3 out of 5 times and is remarkably slow (without vibration motor, so you wouldn't know whether it unlocked or not without looking into screen)3. Super-Amoled display is amazing4. Speaker is avarage5. Screen has no protection (easily gets scratches)6. Battery backup is superb (depends on your uses)7. Camera is strictly avarage8. Processor is just good (expected better)9. Charging takes almost 2.5 hr to bring it from 0% to 100% (still called fast charging?)10. Network reception is very poor (you get very low internet speed)*Software:1. It takes approx 30-40 seconds to turn the phone on2. No good themes or wallpapers are free, you need to buy them 😷. See the screenshots I have attached (MiUi is far better)3. You can't take screenshots or turn the screen off from notification panel (options aren't present, use hardware keys or activate assistant menu)Also, you can't take long screenshots or edit them directly after taking (no doodling option is present in gallery app)Verdict: A lot of phones are present in market with far better specs. Buy it only if you're a die hard fan of Samsung.

i am going to give critical review.Pros1. Samoled display. Amazing. 20 % more attractive than ipc displays2. Battery is good. With 50 percent u can use for 7 hrs with watching 2movies in the gap3. Front cam is nice. Rear cam is poor. Not  worth4. Dolby atmos... though not really the case coz compared this to s9 of my friend.. s9 sounded real dolby not m30 that too can switched on when u put earphones on.. nonetheless volume will be bit louder if u turn it onCons1.  Frequently it lags. Experienced that trouble in chrome. So 1.8ghz lrocessor not enough go for 2.3 processor.2. User interface is not that good.3. Too many inbuilt samsung apps and google apps. Also no INBUILT APP LOCK this becomes a trouble when u want to install applock app.. if some one uninstall ur app then no security..  only inbuilt app can provide this facility3. MOVING FILES FROM INT MEM TO SD CARD IT TAKING TOO MUCH TIME.  Irritates me4. No vibration sensor. Also if u lock the phone and try fingerprint it should stay on display but it wont show display if u put wrong finger.5. Earphones should have been given. Conclusion  Not worth for 11999 but worth for 9000 only.. processor matters lot. So go for m30s... or like vivo z1 pro..

New generation phone at affordable price

Pros:1. Display quite smooth and pleasing.2. Don't think about polycarbonate body, build is good.3. Batery backup as compare to 5k is ok.Corns:1. Don't get puzzled by youtube review, camera is just ok as it include AI, pixel is not clear but for social media it will do the job.2. Design i think samsung followed the trend and other brand. My first notch display phone, thought it's gonna be ok, but trust me it looks really odd.3. Speaker sound quality not good, not a bit loud, just a cheap sound like low budget phone.4. Main thing where it comes to PUBG? You wont enjoy the gaming with the frame drop in balanced mode with medium frame rate. Lag is effective , lol the design is poor they have kept the speakar gaap in the bottom side so u will face interruption while gaming, the grip won't go easy as it have headphone jack also in the bottom- left. Which will definitely make u feel odd while gaming in loudspeaker or headphone. Even after 7days of use it has started to lag in basic/normal graphics with medium fram rate.I am a Samsung lover, where as i won't recommend you to waste money on this brand. They don't deserve the frame anymore.Only thing i have now is regret after purchase M30.

It's good but I HATE IT

I thought, Samsung is back with good phones and hence I tried it once again. Samsung is bad choice forever for me. I decided, will never buy Samsung phones in future.I received phone and noticed two major issues with this phone1. It heats up a lot when I travel. Of course, in AC room it will not heated up.2. Noise. So there is no voice clarityI booked return request then I came to know that this phone will not be returned but will be replaced. They inspected this phone and declared that it isn't  any fault in this phoneThey send a so called technical expert at my home. He told me that due to notch, there is not much space to adjust the speaker and mic hence in this model, you will find same voice or noise. For him, it is normal.Regarding heating issue, he told me that upto 46degree you can use it and it will be automatically switched off when it will reach up to 46degree. This phone heated up to 41 to 43 degree after few hours of normal internet use.I used to have Redmi note 3S. It was better than this mobile.I am suffering with this mobile without any help and support from Amazon and Samsung

Not upto Samsung Brand value

I made a mistake buying this mobile. So many told me not to buy Samsung mobile for its slowness and network issues, still I went ahead and bought it thinking by now Samsung quality would have bettered but nope. So many issues! First the mobile box had tampered, it looked like very old stock with dirty box. Then the box had only mobile and charger not even screen guard applied. Mobiles back is so plasticky and such a ugly looking! Only the amoled display is worth looking at. Finger print reader is so bad and slow, it takes a while to unlock or react. You doubt whether you properly kept the finger or not.Is been 10 days and phone is ashtray slow. Screen gets hung when some app is open and you get a call. Also, it gets hung when you get a call and try to silence it by pressing start button. Sometimes you feel even touch isn't working but it's because the app reaction is slow in this mobile.Good things I liked are amoled display, dark mode, customizations and some actions given to finger print reader like pulling down navigation bar.

For the extra 2000 bucks, you get an AMOLED screen, better selfies, better connectivity (dual-band Wi-Fi), and a better portrait mode for the rear camera.When compared to the new and emerging competition like Redmi Note 7 Pro, the Galaxy M30 has its advantages (AMOLED display, HD streaming, software, battery, fast charging) and let downs (performance, primary rear camera, plastic body), but it should still largely bank on the Samsung brand value to win the bout. The Note 7 Pro leads in several key aspects.If you are not much into high-end gaming, would value display quality over the camera performance, and are restricted by a budget, the Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint. You could also look into stretching your budget a bit for Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50.*Pros*Excellent DisplayBattery backupSupports HD streamingDedicated card slotUSB Type-C port and fast charging*Cons*No notification lightNot for heavy gamingNo case cover in the boxplastic buildNote:-  no headphone, back cover, screen guard available in box only charger and sim ejector tool is their

If you are thinking about a good budget device then, Go For It.I've used this device for 7 months, in order to know about it current opinion, scroll down.Pros:-1. 5000 MAh Battery capacity!!2. Triple rear Camera.3. 16 MP front camera.4. Full Screen (Notch) Display.5. Super Amoled Display (gives the best colours possible)6. Affordable!Cons:-1. It has Exynos processor for some reasons so you won't get to play very high graphics games very smoothly like you used to with sanpdragon...2. Dosenot have a Metal Body which would have made it more scratch resistant...3. I've heard that its face lock feature isn't that good but I haven't faces any issues with it so far...Edit 1: After using it for a month, mobile suddenly was unable to charge, had to replace the charging port. And you will get a lot of scratches so, a cover is highly recommended!Edit 2: Was Working Good for first 6 months but now, there are quiet a lot of issues like1. Can't use Internet through WiFi.2. Unresponsive incoming call interface.3. Fingerprint sensor barely works.4. Heating problem while charging.5. Weak processor, hence device struggles a lot getting some tasks done.6. Service Center cannot help me with any of these issues... 😐So, here's my final conclusion. If you are laughing to use it for only 5-6 months, it's a biut deal. This device is not for a long run.

Good Camera and Display, Processor not so much

Awasome phone with awasome specification, but i personaly feels phone's big screen sometime difficult to use.Detail review and why I gave 3 start reasons are as follow:Cons first:1. It started heating after 2 months of use that too I am not using it very roughly. In total 24 hours of day i am using it not more than 2 hours (including everything).2. Battery start draining fast compare to initial days. During initial days with the same usage it is used to last for two and half days but now it is lasting not more than one and half day.3. Started hanging up (stopped working). Specially while using camera.4. Camera quality is not as per expectation. Front cemera is okay but rear cemeras not able to capture things in detail. If you click a photo with rear camera and zoom it, the image will start tearing and blurring. Not very effective for students those who are rely on photos for their studies. Its personal experience.5. Fingerprint sensor is little bit slow. It takes 1 or 1.5 seconds to respond.Pros:1. Good and stylish looking phone.2. Adaptive display feature is awasome. No need to change the brightness setting while moving from dark to under sun light or vice versa, it adjust automatically.3. Good torch with adjustable brightness.4. Good sound clearity.I wish most of the cons will be eliminated with software update.And i wish this review will be helpful to the needed one.

A few months after I bought it, the camera stopped working, went to the service centre, they did smthg and sent me back home saying  ""it's good now"" even when I told them to do more thorough checks. Well, I was right and had to go back a couple of days again and had to leave it there because the camera software was apparently damaged ir smthg. After two years  now it's the same problem. It's a good phone, even the camera quality is good. The speakers are ok. But this thing is literally making me want to break it

I'm just a normal user i don't play games or use lot of apps so my reviews will be most likely on what i felt not great. I purchased this Mobile on March 2019.1. Quality of the camera is not good as per the MP they provided.2. if we watch online videos more than 2 hours heat is producing (may be quit common for all)3. Apps are keep on gets hang maybe low RAM size.4. very less inbuilt features when compared with other brands like MI

Don't regret buying this phone one bit

Average phone... you're better off with an Asus or a moto.. the UI is very inconvenient.. takes a lot of getting used to.. even then using the phone is an annoyance rather than second nature.The screen is super bright so that's a plus . And the battery backup is very very good... if it was a more sturdy build would have served a better purpose as a work phone coz you don't have to ask anyone for a damn charger.That stupid pin with which you take the sim slot out should be banned for all phones. Could have had some other mechanism or at least give me a place to keep it..The colour reproduction is okay... seems a bit washed out.Random bugs and lags especially during basic functions like calls... very very annoying.Finally the biggest drawback... the touch accuracy is down the drain... I have to touch min 5 times to pause a damn video... it's a nightmare if I want to skip ahead.So if you need a phone maybe just to call and basic WhatsApp then this is the guy .. doesn't look too shabby... performs alright.. battery is awesomeness.But if you want a little more out of your phone.. just go to the other 5000 mah battery ones.Only reason I got this phone was for the fast charging 5000 mah battery which I wasn't  getting anywhere else.

Received it today.firstly the screen and display is great but the polycarbonate body looks real cheap for this price range.Checked through the settings and apps.well you will not find any lag for now.I believe thats same for all smart phones at this range.Guys dont go for this phone if you are camera savvy, its not the right deal. Although its usp is triple rear camera but its not just that good enough.Wide angle is superb but colour correction and AI control is no atall upto the mark. Note 7 pro, samsung j30 will be ranked way above these model.Front camera is ok and take decent photos.there is a pro mode in camera but not much manual option to p;lay with other that iso and exposure control.Video mode has literally no features.just point and shoot.Atleast expected slowmo and time lapse is 15k budget phone.Battery is good and fast 15w charger was in the package.

A perfect phone at a practical price!

The plus point of this phone is the display, ultra wide camera and the battery life. If you're someone who takes a lot of photos, and consumes a lot of media on there device then this phone is for you.Pros:-sAMOLED Display-Ultra Wide Lens-Battery LifeCons-Slower Processor-Software (Samsung Experience 9.5 looks dated design wise)-Plastic BodyPersonally I haven't noticed much difference in using the AMOLED Display but this might change with time. One thing you might need to keep in mind (I found out about this a little too late) is the processor is closed source so third party ROMs development might not be there. They should have shipped it with Android P and the one UI which is more polished. If you want a phone for camera and media consumption then buy the M30, otherwise if you want a durable phone with better android experience and processor get the Moto One Power.EDIT: After a week of usage I do not find the camera upto the mark, Images lack sharpness and they look a grainy when zoomed in even a bit. This was a huge let down as I expected this phone to have a better camera.

Samsung M30 - a sleek monster

This age samsung phones are nothing, when it comes to feel and user experience. The time the phone was first unboxed, the touch felt hard,but worked without error. Everything else good, camera clearer and real like, clearer than redmi phones, amoled also was ok, definitely amoled, but not very bright and colorful display. The back of phone also was over heating,I called up customer service, they said install all updates, it might change . But even after that, overheating is showing in the processor side and full screen ,when one game starts. The touch problem could not be solved completely, as this was not a appreciable error ,but only weak response and hard touch. I never felt like playing any game with such a touch and poor power behind the handset. Tried all touch repair apps from play store, and reset the phone also, but this never comes to a new phone touch feel. Terrible experience!! Even many China phones do more justice to everything. Samsung phones are only a name sake top notch.

I've never invested more than 8k for the two  smartphones I've used. I'm also not a guy who repeatedly keeps changing phones. So when my previous phone started giving me minor issues, felt it was the right time to buy a new one and upon being suggested by my friend, choose the Samsung m30, 6Gb Ram, 128 Gb variant. It's almost been 3 months since I bought this phone. It's pretty much like all Samsung phones filled with a wide range of applications, user friendly UI etc coupled with few new features.Pros.1. Good camera- Front camera in particular is very good. Also the wide angle rear camera helps you to capture a wider picture.2. Battery- Never ever did I think a smartphone would give a 24hr battery backup. I extensively use my phone for social media apps, netflix, Amazon prime etc but the battery life the phone has got is amazing. You won't even need a powerbank. You also get a fast charger which takes roughly 90 min for one full charge.3. Lockscreen stories- This feature is something new I've come across but nonetheless, is pretty amazing. Helps you keep upto date with the current affairs stories you are interested in while the screen is locked.4. Dolby atmos- Gives you a much better sound experience when using a headset. It is also categorised for various age groups and type of usage such as music, movies etc.Cons.1. Fingerprint sensor - It has been an issue as it doesn't detect your fingerprints sometimes.2. Ringtone- Not sure whether the feature is same for all Samsung phones, but the ringtone automatically increases and decreases. From what I've read across the internet, I've come to know that it is a feature that works based on the surroundings you/the phone is in.All in all, the phone is a decent buy for the price. Suggested for people whose usage is a lot and don't want their battery to drain quickly.

Got this phone around a month ago. My earlier phone was moto g5s plus. I am a moderate user of phone who keeps on hanging with internet and all the required essential  apps, I also  play games at times.Now what good about m 30 for me is:1. Premium  software quality with no ads.2. Excellent display.3. Better performance  compared to my moto phone. This was where I surprised even though on papers this phone has not very powerful processors but still it gives it's best when comes to background  app management. I have not felt any heating issues or lag issues even after using heavy apps for hours!4. Good front camera.5. Excellent  battery  life . Comes around 2.5 days for me.Some cons:1. Even though primary camera is good. But does not give it's best in low light.2. Yes its software is premium with ad free but i was expecting Samsung UI 1 which is available  in A series.3. Speaker could have been amplified more.Overall a very practical  phone which gives u a premium  feel especially  due to its display.Many people compare this with redmi note 7 pro. I agree note 7 pro is a good phone which has better processor but you cannot feel the same premium experience as m 30 here is why:1. Just compare the both display!2. Check out note 7 apps filled with full ads.3. Even though they claim 48 mp it's not always! it it gives u in pro mode with no zoom option.4 microphone and headset audio of m 30 is better.5. Note 7 is a perfect phone for teen agers who is more intrested in gaming or heavy usage. M 30 is for professional  and moderate  users who are more intrested in quality for primary usage of phone.

Samsung M30 is an excellent value for money. At the price range, it offers competent configurations. I have been using it for over a month and here are my reviews:Over all performance: Satisfactory. Though I bought the 6GB variant, there is no comparable improvement in performance when compared to a 3 GB variant. That being said, I have not observed significant delay in boot time of apps and concurrent background apps continue from the last session rather than re-launching.Camera: I am slightly unhappy with the 13MP primary camera. With the other configurations being competitive, a 13 MP primary camera seems amateurish. The picture quality retains the standard and with ambient light, pictures are of good quality. The 16 MP front camera is impressive and captures good selfie images. The other features of wide angle lens of primary camera, subject focus of both front and rear camera are also impressive and lives up to the expectation.Battery: The 5000 mAh battery is quite a mammoth. Do not expect it to last 2 days though. The idea is that with a good screen use throughout the day, there will still be some juice left in the battery to last the night. This seems reasonable battery backup before charging it up again.Media: The display and video effects are quite good. The DolbyAtmos needs a special mention which gives a notch to the audio experience when an ear phone is plugged in.OS: I received Oxygen in the boxed set and was a big disappointed. But Samsung released Pie with One UI within a month and this elated my mood.Overall its a very good smart phone to use at this price point. It would have been a nice though to include a silicone back cover and a screen guard in the box.If brand is of importance to you, then Samsung M30 will be worthy choice for you to consider.

AN EXCELLENT OPTION -VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY

First, i don't play game.Second, my primary purpose of buying this phone is watching web series and movies through Amazon Prime Videos and doind daily  normal uses.In Highest quality there is a option to download videos through prime videos is 1.8Gb/hr but honestly it will download only lass than 1Gb data in highest quality. The best part is you can play Prime videos in whole screen like which is not able to play in Redmi Note 8, which is also a full hd display phone.In realme 3 pro the maximum download quality option available is 2.3 Gb/hr, so it download better quality videos as compared  to Samsung galaxy M30 or Redmi Note 8.If your purpose is not watching prime videos than go for Redmi 8, yes simply 8, which has the best battery backup i have ever experienced. Lasts for 2 day through intense use.You can't compare the video quality through youtube or a video in your sd card ( videos will look approximately same in all these phones) but when you will start watching online contents (Amazon prime videos,  Netflix  etc) then there will be a major difference between these phones.Samsung M30 Android 10 experience after updates is very smooth. You can uninstall majority of preinstalled apps like Google play music, movies, books etc which you can't do in Redme note 8 and Realme 3 pro. There will be many advertisements in the realme and redme in there pre installed apps which you can't uninstall or even disable,but not in Samsung M30.For daily uses 3gb ram and 32gb memory of m30 is more than enough i didn't experience any lag or hang,works smoothly.

I have been using this mobile for quite some time now and to give a gist I have to say that there are a few compromises made to give consumers some decent specs.Some good stuff,Battery life is amazing.It gives me 1.5 days of power and still there is some 15% mostly remaining. Only 30% is sufficient to drive your day with normal usage of emails, songs and 30 mins of YouTube.Charges fastLittle more than half an hour is sufficient for 45% charge.CameraYou can not underestimate m30 here, it can take some serious photographs, if you do the settings right.DisplayOnly one word, Wow!SafeOther manufacturers in this range are mostly Chinese and everyone is aware that china is known for data theft. I might be wrong on this but anyways I don't trust these brands anymore.3.5 mm Jack not at top.This is a very specific issue, for me this is good because if you have wired earphones, wire handling becomes very easy.Some bads,Fingerprint scannerIt is the slowest I have ever used, although you will get used to it.BodyI have never used this phone without a cover, ever though it has developed big scratches at it's back. They are noticable even from a distance, if I remove the cover.Wide angle lensIt is there for just name sake, it doesn't take good photographs.Overall if you have used your old phone for quite some time and are looking for a phone for next couple of years, I think this is an option worth considering.Please note that I am not a heavy user!

Samsung has really created a masterpiece. I have been using it for the last 10 days. I have used other Samsung phones but this one is something different. Here, I am listing the pros and cons of this mobile phone.Pros -1- The battery is great. 5000 mah battery give you more than a full day backup on moderate use. The power saving mode of Samsung is worth going for. Use it wisely and I guess the juice will not run out for 2 or more days. I have tried that recently while I was traveling.2- Display is awesome. It feels.3- Design is also great. I have the blue one and it looks beautiful. The navigation settings let you make the navigation buttons disappear and you experience a better screen.4- The fast charging works really fast.5- Camera is great. Both front and back. Especially in low light conditions. Flash is awesome. Zoom is also great.6- No Hybrid slot is what I seek in the phones these days. Thus, you are not limited by the storage issue if you are using the dual sim.7- Dual 4g is good. Now, I can use my BSNL 3g and at the same time, my Jio works fine.8- Face recognition and fingerprint unlocking are very fast.9- Touch sensitivity is very much.10- I got 200GB space on One Drive for two years free with this device.Cons -1- The wide angle lens needs some improvement. The picture quality is just OK. But as this is a new experience, I would not say its a major con.2- The placement of earphone is downwards so when you want to use your phone earphone and charger plugged in, it becomes a little difficult to operate.For now, this is my experience, I'll keep updating.

SAMSUNG Galaxy M30 is simply great Phone from SAMSUNG under Rs.15000/-

I have always been a Samsung user and am always appreciating Samsung for their amazing services.I was looking for a new device and I was very head bent on the Samsung M30 the day I saw it.I am using the 4 + 64GB version in blue and it works just so well!!I am very happy with my device and recommend it to everyone looking for something in the price range.The 50000 mAh battery is just so helpful and very rare in mobiles, with normal usage on Wifi I get upto 3 full days of battery backup!And also you can fully charge the phone with the fast charger from 0 to 100 in just 2-3 hrs!The features are just unlimited and the device feels actually premium to use.An added feature of Samsung is that the phone damage can be repaired almost anywhere you are and it won't even cost you much.Plus Samsung is both, durable and reliable, even with the 4GB RAM I can play games with a lot of clarity!The device also doesn't heat up!The screen is vivid and almost every setting can be customized very easily and effectively for every person.The Samsung in-built apps might seem like a burden, but if you turn off the notifications, they're really helpful in gaming and multitasking!I have never experienced any system error in this device, if I have got any, it is due to some error I made, for which I was helped by the Samsung online chat service step by step.Samsung phones also have many many in-built features like antivirus, automatic cache memory cleaner and device booster that improve the performance of the product.With smart view one can connect easily to almost any TV set for screen mirroring. And the camera quality is just so cool! I don't even need to search for wallpapers, I can easily just take out my phone, look for a scene I like and click!Whatever I say is less, this phone is a must buy!The best choice ever!!

I recently bought a Galaxy M30 phone and I am fully satisfied with it. Thanks to the 6GB RAM, there is no perceptible delay in processing any command. Then there is the 128 GB Memory, which is more than a match for the videos which one gets very frequently on WhatsApp groups. The 5000 aAh battery enables it to run for two days without charging. Thanks to the C type charging cable, it gets fully charged in about an hour (earlier, I had to charge my phone each night, but sometimes I ran out of juice by evening).Feature by feature, M30 is better than the J8 I was using earlier, but it cost me less than what I paid for J8 less than a year ago. M30 also compares quite well with the higher priced A50 which my nephew uses - the specifications are nearly identical, but the camera is superior in M30.This phone is described as ""Made for India"" and Samsung seems to have done away with all the frills in terms of packaging - in other words, the box is quite flimsy. Apart from the handset itself, all you get is a data cable, a travel adaptor and an ejection pin - there are no earphones which used to be a standard accessory in earlier models. However, no compromises have been made in the specifications and the manufacturing quality of the phone itself.On the whole, an excellent option for Samsung fans - the latest features and very good value for money too!

The device which I am using is Samsung Galaxy M30 which comes with 6gb RAM and 128gb of storage.Samsung Galaxy M30 is powered by a 1.8GHz octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor that features 2 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and 6 cores clocked at 1.6GHz. It has Mali G71 gpu.Coming to the display it has 6.40-inch infinity U superAMOLED FullHD+ touchscreen and an aspect ratio of 19.5 : 9.The screen has very good viewing angles and looks very punchy.It has that auto brightness option too.Moving on to the camera it has a rear triple camera setup which is a very nice thing.We have 13 MP main camera @ f1.9 + 5MP Wide Angle camera + 5 MP Depth sensing camera.Moving to to the front camera it's a 16MP shooter.It's having a huge 5000 mAh battery which is a good thing for heavy users. We can easily get 10-12. Hrs of screentime in this device.Moving on to the charger it has USB type-C port which is actually a good thing. The charger is a fast charger that is 9 Volts at 1.6 ampere.Coming on to the device it has a polycarbonate back with gradiant colour i.e. at the top it is more bluish and becomes black at the bottom. It actually gives it a premium look and also at the back we have finger unlock sensor.In addition it has a dual SIM slot(both 4G) plus a dedicated micro SD slot also which is a nice thing as well.Its memory is expandable up to 512 gb.The phone has Android oreo 8.1 and Samsung Experience 9.5 UI.It's a good phone with good built quality and I like all the features especially the tripple camera setup. It has that wide angle lens which gives a different perspective and it is a good feature to have on a smartphone. The pictures come out to be good with good colours.The camera does a very good job in low light conditions also.It's a value for money kind of a device!

This Phone is above this world of android phones.""FINGERPRINT READER"" is as good as the eye power of detecting objects in 1/16th of a second.And when I say ""BATTERY LIFE"", you can talk more than 24 hours in single full charge. U can use internet as much as you can by charging once in a day. U can play games, listen to music (YouTube) , video calling and much more u can do. This phone has that much battery life, you will forget when was the last time you charged the phone.U always don't need to bring your charger with you, if you are on a one day outing.And it's FAST CHARGING"" is also amazing, the phone takes approx 40 minutes to full charge.Without using internet, I can guess, u can use the phone for minimum 3/4 days.And one more thing, ULTRA POWER SAVING MODE, after applying this mode u can use the phone for a complete day even in 10% charging and u can use 6-8 Apps in this mode, u can use internet too.And I thinking I don't need to review it's CAMERAS bcoz I have no words to praise the cameras, Such amazing high quality pictures with amazing filters of different colours , u can record videos in very high resolution.When we talk about SCREEN, it has very attractive and colourful screen, when u touch u can feel the smoothness. Pixels of the screen are very good, u can use YouTube upto 4K.And when we talk about RAM and INTERNAL STORAGE u have 4 GB Ram and 64 GB internal storage, you will NEVER face HANG problem.And it is just a overview, there is much much more in this phone, u will never regret buying this phone.I strongly recommend this phone to each and everyone. I'm using it since June , from that day I haven't faced any problem.

First of all I would like to inform you that I am writing this review after 2month of purchase of m30 black 4gb ram. This is the best in in mid range of 15k. Phone has got its update i.e. android 9 which is awesome. Phone has super battery performance.once fully charged phone can run up to 2 days in normal usage. Phone is awesome for gaming user but I will recommend them to got with 6gb ram variants. Talking with phone design the front panel is looking sexy,and as well as back.one issue with back panel is that it is very slippery you need to handle it properly if you didn't have back cover.coming with camera quality front 16 megapixel is awesome I can't imagine the picture quality in this range of phone only issue with front camera is low light issues.secondly if we talk about primary camera it's too good.triple camera with wide angle is awesome.even low light is not a big deal.i have posted some pictures for camera quality. Talking about fingerprints it is placed little above so in starting you will face some issues while using it but at later stage it will be okay for you. For charging they had provided type c charger which is very much cool. Full phone will get charged within less than 2hrs reason as battery is 5000 mah so it is taking some time but if you charging for 30 mins also it's enough for 5 to 6 hrs. Only think which I am disappointed is that they didn't provide earphone Talking about overall performance phone is awesome I had used it for 2months and personally I am very much satisfied with phone performance Samsung had done wonderful job in mid segment price range. I would also thank Amazon India which delivers the product within 1 day. If you desire any phone under 15k m30 is best which I will recommend.

I have purchased SAMSUNG Galaxy M30 on 30/04/2019 (delivered on 01/05/2019) and using it for past 4 months. I love all the features and till date there is no complaint from my side.The advantages of SAMSUNG Galaxy M30 according to me are:1. Network - It remains stable most of the time, I use Vodafone and Jio network.2. Body -  It's dimension is 159 x 75.1 x 8.5 mm and weight is just 174 gm, nice and slim to hold in hand.3. Display - Super AMOLED display so no stains to eyes and smooth touch.4. Platform - Android 8.1 (Oreo), upgradable to Android 9.0 (Pie); One UI (My phone is upgraded after 20 days of purchase) and Exynos 7904 octa-core processor never lets the phone slow down.5. Memory - I use 4GB+64 GB device, I can assure no hanging or lagging problem even if you use it for continuous 1-2 hours with several apps running.6. Camera - Triple rear camera (13+5+5 MP) with 16 MP selfie camera is simply awesome.7. Sound - Dolby Atmos sound with active noise cancelation, functioning great.8. Sensors - Fingerprint sensor is rear mounted and believe me till date no issue with the sensor, working pretty smoothly.9. Battery - Li-Po 5000 mAh battery with Fast battery charging 15W, Full charge completes within 1.5 hours if you put charge at 15% battery remaining and trust my according my usage it stays for whole 2 days after normal usage of device.10. Miscellaneous - Wi-Fi 802.11, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS is there, FM Radio with recording, USB 2.0 Type-C with reversible connector and most important SAR of galaxy M30 is 0.41 W/kg (Low radiation)After using it for about 4 months it's all well and simply amazing.Thank you SAMSUNG and AMAZON for making my life awesome.- Nilendu Saha (Kolkata, West Bengal)

I bought this for my 2 daughter who had kidnapped my wife's AND my phone everyday and refuses to give it until we threaten them with the police/indian army/indian airforce etc.My married life was going to hell, my wife was irritated and frustrated, she was threatening with divorce. Everyday once we reach home our phones disappears and only appears once our daughters go to school in the morning. I had to check my mails in my laptop instead of my phone which is more convenient as well. Many days I leave office late so that I have my phone in my possession, and this was causing health problems for me.I was on a crucial turining point in my life.Then I saw this AD from Samsung. My life was about to change for ever.I placed order and it was delivered in the same day.And our life was reset. We were back to early days of our daughters who would happily ignore me and my wife's existence and just do thier own stuff without any troubles.Once we bought this phone, we are leading a happy life. Our phones no more disappears, I can leave my phone on a table or sofa and goto toilet and come back with the phone being in the excat same place where I had left it.It was bliss.And I can check my mails in my own phone instead of laptop. My wife has also started loving me again, she dropped the idea of divorcing me.We are only little happy family because of M30.Ah about the phone, its a excellent phone, just go ahead and buy it.

Pros:> Display is very cool. On par with flagship phones.> Battery life is great.> Camera quality is fair, comparing it with previous generation samsung phones.> Touch is very smooth. Much smoother than the competition redmi note 7 pro. And also a better display than the same.> fast charger is included in the box!> Widevine L1 certified, so you can watch shows and youtube videos in HD.> really good fast charging. Goes from 10 to 100 percent in 2 hours, and then lasts 2 days with moderate usage. Even a quick 10 minutes charge will help you keep your phone alive for the rest of your day.> triple camera setup with a wide angle lens for great landscape pictures.Cons> processor not powerful enough. Not a good choice for hardcore gamers. But you can play games on low quality.> night camera is okayish. Could have been better.> no 4k video, not even 60fps option in the videos, so there is no slowmo either.> Aspect ratio is a bit odd. Videos are slighty zoomed in on apps. Even instagram stories are slightly zoomed in to fit on screen. There must be a way to change it but I have yet to discover the setting.> No gorilla glass and polycarbonate back. Both sides are prone to scratches.But it if:You are a student and spend a lot of time on phone studying and taking notes.If you want to watch shows online and youtube in good quality.If you want a phone that lasts long (in terms of battery).Don't buy if you want a high-performance phone.Rating: 8/10. The phone is good for its price. You won't get this display at this price in any other phone. The battery and fast charging are a nice addition.

I bought the 6GB+128GB Black variant. First of all, for people who are complaining about unable to play PUBG, FOR GOD'S SAKE INCREASE YOUR BUDGET OR GO FOR OTHER BRANDs. This phone is for people who are looking for a better display, long battery life and Advertisement free OS (sick of Xiaomi).Battery- I get around 8+ hrs of screen ontime with 50% brightness. My phone is connected to Wifi 95% of the time with 2 4G connections running in the background. I have multiple BT devices which were operated through this phone. I have been torrenting, listening to music, watching videos in YT, Netflix, calling for 2+ hrs, texting, trying out new apps etc and still left with 15% battery. Although, fast charger of 15 W is orovided with the phone but I use a 18W MI charger. Now thats a battery😀Screen- Its super Amoled screen, therefore, the video quality is extremy good  The colors are correctly saturated with deep blacks making video watching a pleasant experience. It also comes with L1 Widevine support, so you can stream videos in HD. Overall, a very good display in this budget.OS- Not as good as stock android ( yes I prefer stock android) but comes with a lot of customization which increases the productivity. However, there are no irritating advertisements anywhere in the OS unlike Xiaomi phones.Operation- Smooth so far with good RAM management. I did not face any lag whike using multiple apps. But a few more updates to One UI will be good.Storage- You get 100+ GB free when you boot the phone for the first time and you get a dedicated SD card slot.Camera- I prefer DSLR for photos, however, for casual shots, its ok.

received defective piece
","
Phone is defective, battery is draning and headphone is not working.  Amazon got the products tested and they accepted the phone is not working properly.  After, I asked replacement on  Oct 15, 2022 and then replacement order came on Oct 22, 2022. Delivery executive asked charger for the replacement even though there is no charger inside the box !!! and as a result he rejected replacement. After I connected with Amazon customer care, they sent the second delivery for replacement on 28 Oct. The second person did not know how to check IMEI of the phone !!,  he checked everything he again rejected to replace defective phone with the new one.  Now replacement order was cancelled by Amazon without giving any reason. I tried to connect with customer care too many times  and I asked their concern team just to replace defective phone with a new one. Amazon left the customer behind and did not provide any solution.  Item is defective and I asked only replacement. Amazon did not want to replace it accordingly.  I felt cheated by Amazon and the Seller. I was only asking replacement with properly working phone.  I do not recommend to buy this phone as it is premium model and the seller, Samsung and Amazon did not provide enough service to fix the issue. It is just headache and stress.

 I wouldn't know if the phone is any good or not as I received a defective piece and Amazon is not replacing it.The zoom lenses don't work in low light, there is no focus and the shots are bad quality. Even in daylight, the video keeps getting out of focus. On top of it, there's extreme heating issue. Even though I only used the phone to test all features, it got heated up within 10 minutes of use. I reported this immediately within the return/replacement window, they assigned a technician to look into it and after assuring that it will be replaced, they have ghosted me. They keep saying ""we've escalated your report"". It's been a month since I've purchased it.Samsung is not willing to address it, saying that since this purchase is via Amazon, only they can handle it as per their terms.This phone was way out of my budget and it's useless. My OnePlus 7T captures better pictures, videos.If it's an expensive product, avoid buying from Amazon and rather try the phone at the store and buy directly there.

Before I review the device, this is available for much lower price (without offer). But I have ordered this device with offers (assuming smart watch would be provided for the extra price 17K paid compared to the other seller).  I agree nothing is mentioned in the Description, but the samsung store is selling the bundle 22 ultra and galaxy 4  with the same price as 109999.  In the questions about the product mentioned samsung India (the manufacturer) has mentioned multiple times that Galaxy watch is included and I have chosen this model because of this. Now I can't return the device until I find an issue with the mobile and ended up paying 17K extra for no reason. When I call amazon customer care they told me to check with samsung as the comments are made by samsung in the questions section. When I check with samsung they satI have to call up amazon since I made the purchase from amazon.!  Appario Retail ..please correct the discrepancy and help me get the rightful value by Enabling Me to buy the Galaxy watch with the offer price of the bundle (as mentioned by Samsung India)

I ordered the product on 22nd September. Got it delivered on 27th September. Put the SIM card on 28th September.From that day, fingerprint is not working at all. Then I thought, I'll get it replaced which was there in the policy. Amazon changed the policy itself. They changed the policy direct to return the product, not replaced.I went to Samsung store to get it checked. They put the IMEI number in their portal & got to know that phone was activated on 22nd September itself. Someone else from Jammu & Kashmir had put the SIM card in this phone & would have used it.I called Amazon customer care & no resolution till today. They are asking me to return which is also comes under my loss.My request is to get this replaced on priority. Hope they will see this review & reply back at least somewhere.

These brands sell their ""flagships"" on a premium cost, each having a different charging port specifications, and yet decides not to include the essential adaptor.On top that, they have the audacity to call this decision as a pro environment decision when in reality we would be forced to purchase the adaptor separately, inviting more plastic waste.A one star is the least consumers can do against this corporate bs.

Worst battery life
","
When i bought s22 ultra 5g (512gb variant), there was mentioned that I will be eligible for a 7 day replacement only If the need arise as such. The phone was working good but there was some heating issue with this phone. I contacted the AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE and there they replied "" Only 2 phones are left out and hands we cannot replace your profuct"". My simple question1. If 2 phones are left out then why am I not prioritized, because I have already paid for a phone which is not working up to its rank in full amount of front a week before.  I never asked for the refund then why am I not allowed to replace my product.2.  If this kind of situations are going to happen then why do Amazon boast of a 7 day ""replacement only"" guarantee if  a genuine need arise as such However Amazon is kind enough to take a return of my phone and to refund the amount, But this is not a shopping experience where a high valued customer would really desire, wherein a hefty amount is being locked for so long without even customer satisfaction.

this phone i have bought for 1lac rupees just after reading the great review on its performance but the truth is revealed to me once i have received the handset.If you are buying one phone which costs you arround 1Lac rupees then in my opinion we should not compromise the performance of the product.but i am facing the following issues in the phone -1. Charging this phone is taking longer time then ther other fast charging phones used to take, also it is getting heat up a little bit.2. Front Camera is really very bad, if you try to zoom the selfies even a little bit the picture will be scattered.3. It is hanging once you try to do multitasking.

Not worth the price

This is a great phone- excellent camera, decent battery life. But one big problem there is no insurance or care plus pack offered for this on Amazon. I bought from Amazon but sadly I dropped the phone and had to replace the screen for 21k. It was suprising to see samsung care plus being offered for other samsung phones. Tempered glass renders the fingerprint reader inactive and hence only screen guards can be used, which offers some basic protection. I hope people thinking of buying this phone read this review and actually go to a retail outlet which provides the care package for this phone. Trust me you need it. I am told you can get the samsung care pack within 1 month of purchase of online but who wants to go thru all that hassle. Other than the fragile screen, one other complaint I have about the phone camera is you can't shoot slow motion video with zoom. IPhone 13 offers this. The feature I love about this phone is S-Pen, its great for whiteboarding on office calls or taking notes.

Okayish phone but WAY over priced!!

I bought this product purely for photography purpose. But it's nonhood than any ordinary quality. It's optical zoom of 10x is not of good quality at all. The digital zoom upto 100x is a sham. The details get completely lost even in photos taken in normal mode. The battery discharges very fast, especially when the camera is activated. The camera gets heated up fast too.

A Good cellphone but as per it's price and specification, battery installed is inappropriate.

Almost everything about this phone is perfect. The screen, the speed, the connectivity, the call quality, Dex interface, the cameras (best picture quality i have seen in a while) are all amazing that you can't praise them enough.However, the Snapdragon 8 gen 1 is the worst choice of chipset for this beauty. If this had packed the 8+ gen 1, it would have been on a different level. The phone heats to 41° with just about 15 mins of gaming. And the processor is so inefficient that the power usage is high. 5000 mah drains fast and doesn't charge fast enough. Yes this is a criticism of the chipset but the phone comes with it. So the brunt falls on the phone.Overall, am not happy with this purchase. I wanted this phone to be an all-rounder, which it isn't. The heat and the battery drain just spoil the entire experience. Hopefully the next iteration would redeem itself. But I am stuck with this phone for now at least sadly.

Great phone with its own probs

Somehow the photos don't give a sharpness and seem to be disappointing bearing in mind a 108MP. They appear pixilated and more like a oil pastel pic when zoomed. My Samsung S10+ did a 10 times better job in pics. I'm I the only one facing this problem? I took it to the store, but the retail guys try to convince me with their crappy sales pitch that it clicks the way it is supposed to. I also took it to the service centre, they said the larger the size of the screen, and higher the resolution, it impacts the output. Besides, if clicked in an indoor environment and decent lights if gives a very normal/standard output, they say you need to click outdoor to get that clarity (which has more natural lighting)- that made no sense to me as I never had this issue in my S10+. I'm not convinced after spending so much.

Good Purchase but a disappointment that they follow apple and don't deliver the charger

Firstly, coming from iPhone, I found camera to be way too superior compared to iPhone.  Especially when it comes to zooming clicks.When it comes to ease of use, it's good overall. But OS smoothness is not that good compared to OnePlus's Oxygen OS. Apps download and installation takes a lot of time when compared to iPhone and OnePlus.There have been several events where I found apps close down automatically when you start using them. Maybe a software update might help on this. There have been events where the phone has lagged as well.Earlier I had OnePlus 7T Pro 2 years back and that phone was damn smooth and never did it lag at all not did any of the apps crashed u like Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.These were few instances where this phone has disappointed me quite a bit. All these issues can be resolved via software update. So hoping Samsung team might look into it and do the needful.Design is stunning and so is the S Pen.This phone has great aesthetics of how a super phone design should be. Now my mom uses my OnePlus 7T Pro phone and occasionally when I use it, it's too fast even being on Android 11. So, come on Samsung and fix the bugs. We have put so much of trust and money in this phone so we deserve the best experience from the phone of such a name.Rest, I will update my review after I get an OS update to see if the bugs are removed.Thanks!

Camera top notch

I have been using the phone since 10+ days now, and it's been a fantastic experience. This is my first S series phone, that also comes with S-Pen so first Note series as well 😀.Performance:It's buttery smooth as expected from a flagship phone. RAM is pretty much occupied by system but I didn't found any issue while day to day use, and ain't a heavy user as well so can't comment about gaming performance.Battery: it doesn't feel like 5000 mah. Need to charge every morning, sometimes before sleeping at night. Hope Samsung fix it by software update.Camera:Tuning of camera is done very accurately by Samsung. Color levels, exposure, HDR..everything feels perfect. Zoom is extraordinary and perfectly usable till 30x-50x. Still haven't got opportunity for testing the camera in different environments, will update later for that.Accessories:I have applied Spigen screen protector on screen so fingerprint reader is working same as on naked screen, and S-Pen is also working fine I would say (Not smooth as on glass, but perfectly usable).Spigen Liquid Air cover is just perfect to hold the S22 ultra, as it provides extra grip on the sides.Even though it's costlier, I would recommend to buy who has budget for this ULTRA flagship. You will just love it!! 😍

Where as iphone is powerful and extremely efficient beast.Dear Samsung the reason for mobile device is the freedom, the mobility it provides and if your device hangs users to the charger, then we will use more powerful computers instead.यह देखो, रिव्यु लिखते लिखते 3% बैटरी गिर गई.यहां से नीचे का रिव्यू 4 महीने इस्तमाल करने के बाद लिख रहा हूं।तो अनुभव कुछ ऐसा है..की फोन तो भाई मख्खन जैसा है..(लिया भी तो बहुत सारा पैसा है..)अभिभी चिकनापन इसका जैसा का तैसा है।ये फोन दिन ब दोन बेहतरीन होता जा राहा है. अब बॅटरी लाईफ का रिफैंड हुई है. आराम से 5-6 घंटे का Screen on time मिलता है। मुझे अब बैटरी लाइफ से कोई शिकायत नहीं है।बस 1 कमी है जो सैमसंग सॉफ्टवेयर अपडेट से ठीक कर सकता है। वीडियो में शार्पनिंग ज्यादा है जो बहुत आर्टिफिशियल लगता है। बस उतना ठीक करवा दो।बाकी सब चंगा है। 😄

The phone is a beast no questions asked. It worth the every penny you spend. Everything is above the scale:- fast, Snappy.Design is what stood out the most for me though its not much of a difference from it predeccssor still its feels out of the box to hold.Performance is as it should be, best in the game, With Snapdragon 8 gen 1 processor there is alot of a talk about heating however there is no such case with this phone. No matter how heavy user you are or how intense gaming you do this phone handles it all with a ease.Camera:- When i purchased this phone i was really looking forward to experience the camera it offers, If you compare this with best in market iphone 13 pro max, then you wont be disappointed, it offers similar camera quality or in some conditions even better. The dynamic range, saturation, portrait shots all are excellenet in day light. Its nightography function is also extremely good. Talking about video capabilities it offers 8k at 30fps and all other similar in market, its VDIS and OIS feature does make your video rich, steady with prefect light balance. Just like its predecssor this also offers superzoom 100x But all i can add is till 30x its perfectly good after that samsung needs to work on it. Perhaps in next 4-5 years we might be able to have 100x as clear as 30x zoom feature.S Pen:- latency has been reduced to 2.8s which is the super best i can say and also the air gestures is quite fun to use and you can do quite alot with your spen like signing your pdf document on your phone itself without worrying about to get a copy and then signing it.  Using S pen also gets the premium vibe to you in day to day uses it feels bossy.Battery life:- its Good can be better on day to day heavy uses it gets 7-8 hours of screen on time which i feel is already good but its competitor 13 pro max has much better battery compare to it. That generally offers 10 -11 hours of uses which is insane. I would ask samsung to focus on its battery this will generally lead to out perform even apple.Everything else is the best no competition design, performance, One UI, camera, S pen and display. This is phone of the year

I have been using this phone since 28th September, 2022 and am very happy with it.The camera is excellent, took a very clear picture if the moon on Sharad Poornima. Even otherwise, the camera is excellent.Battery life is also good, it lasts for more than 1.5 days for me. Very fast processor and the SPen is really awesome!Go for it if budget permits.All the best!

One of the best android phone ever in current time.1. Screen quality is amazing. (Ultimate brightness) PPI is less  than oneplus 7pro.2. Build quality is awsome No doubt.3. Speaker is good and louder. But compared to oneplus 7pro  i think littlebit lesser sound.4. Camera perfomance is outstanding. Best part is never colour  shifted when you switching the camera between ultra  wide,telephoto,main sensor etc.5. Charging is too lazy, Almost 1 hour 50mins to need.(25watt)6. Reverse charging support.7. Call quality is good no problem on any network. (Depends on  your area)8. Haptic feedback is love. Little better than oneplus 7 pro.9. Bluetooth earphone/headphone output is oaky not so good  Can't hear any heavy bass. That point oneplus 7  pro is beast. (I'm using Sony WI-XB400)10. S22 ultra currently run on android 13 &one UI 5.0 under  beta version but out of the box you get android 12.11. Battary draining too fast but it will be okay after 2-3 weeks  of useges.12. S-pen work very well.

I have recently bought this phone on 16th June. Unfortunately this phone has a high charge drainage issue and does not stay for even 1 day long. Hence, I requested a replacement for the same. But even after one technician visit I did not receive any replacement though he said that the phone has this issue. After this, 5-6 technician visit has been cancelled by then repeatedly and they are claiming the cancellation is from our side. This is horrible experience that I never expected from a renowned e-commerce store like Amazon. Please avoid to buy this phone

received defective piece
","
Phone is defective, battery is draning and headphone is not working.  Amazon got the products tested and they accepted the phone is not working properly.  After, I asked replacement on  Oct 15, 2022 and then replacement order came on Oct 22, 2022. Delivery executive asked charger for the replacement even though there is no charger inside the box !!! and as a result he rejected replacement. After I connected with Amazon customer care, they sent the second delivery for replacement on 28 Oct. The second person did not know how to check IMEI of the phone !!,  he checked everything he again rejected to replace defective phone with the new one.  Now replacement order was cancelled by Amazon without giving any reason. I tried to connect with customer care too many times  and I asked their concern team just to replace defective phone with a new one. Amazon left the customer behind and did not provide any solution.  Item is defective and I asked only replacement. Amazon did not want to replace it accordingly.  I felt cheated by Amazon and the Seller. I was only asking replacement with properly working phone.  I do not recommend to buy this phone as it is premium model and the seller, Samsung and Amazon did not provide enough service to fix the issue. It is just headache and stress.

 I wouldn't know if the phone is any good or not as I received a defective piece and Amazon is not replacing it.The zoom lenses don't work in low light, there is no focus and the shots are bad quality. Even in daylight, the video keeps getting out of focus. On top of it, there's extreme heating issue. Even though I only used the phone to test all features, it got heated up within 10 minutes of use. I reported this immediately within the return/replacement window, they assigned a technician to look into it and after assuring that it will be replaced, they have ghosted me. They keep saying ""we've escalated your report"". It's been a month since I've purchased it.Samsung is not willing to address it, saying that since this purchase is via Amazon, only they can handle it as per their terms.This phone was way out of my budget and it's useless. My OnePlus 7T captures better pictures, videos.If it's an expensive product, avoid buying from Amazon and rather try the phone at the store and buy directly there.

Before I review the device, this is available for much lower price (without offer). But I have ordered this device with offers (assuming smart watch would be provided for the extra price 17K paid compared to the other seller).  I agree nothing is mentioned in the Description, but the samsung store is selling the bundle 22 ultra and galaxy 4  with the same price as 109999.  In the questions about the product mentioned samsung India (the manufacturer) has mentioned multiple times that Galaxy watch is included and I have chosen this model because of this. Now I can't return the device until I find an issue with the mobile and ended up paying 17K extra for no reason. When I call amazon customer care they told me to check with samsung as the comments are made by samsung in the questions section. When I check with samsung they satI have to call up amazon since I made the purchase from amazon.!  Appario Retail ..please correct the discrepancy and help me get the rightful value by Enabling Me to buy the Galaxy watch with the offer price of the bundle (as mentioned by Samsung India)

I ordered the product on 22nd September. Got it delivered on 27th September. Put the SIM card on 28th September.From that day, fingerprint is not working at all. Then I thought, I'll get it replaced which was there in the policy. Amazon changed the policy itself. They changed the policy direct to return the product, not replaced.I went to Samsung store to get it checked. They put the IMEI number in their portal & got to know that phone was activated on 22nd September itself. Someone else from Jammu & Kashmir had put the SIM card in this phone & would have used it.I called Amazon customer care & no resolution till today. They are asking me to return which is also comes under my loss.My request is to get this replaced on priority. Hope they will see this review & reply back at least somewhere.

These brands sell their ""flagships"" on a premium cost, each having a different charging port specifications, and yet decides not to include the essential adaptor.On top that, they have the audacity to call this decision as a pro environment decision when in reality we would be forced to purchase the adaptor separately, inviting more plastic waste.A one star is the least consumers can do against this corporate bs.

Worst battery life
","
When i bought s22 ultra 5g (512gb variant), there was mentioned that I will be eligible for a 7 day replacement only If the need arise as such. The phone was working good but there was some heating issue with this phone. I contacted the AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE and there they replied "" Only 2 phones are left out and hands we cannot replace your profuct"". My simple question1. If 2 phones are left out then why am I not prioritized, because I have already paid for a phone which is not working up to its rank in full amount of front a week before.  I never asked for the refund then why am I not allowed to replace my product.2.  If this kind of situations are going to happen then why do Amazon boast of a 7 day ""replacement only"" guarantee if  a genuine need arise as such However Amazon is kind enough to take a return of my phone and to refund the amount, But this is not a shopping experience where a high valued customer would really desire, wherein a hefty amount is being locked for so long without even customer satisfaction.

this phone i have bought for 1lac rupees just after reading the great review on its performance but the truth is revealed to me once i have received the handset.If you are buying one phone which costs you arround 1Lac rupees then in my opinion we should not compromise the performance of the product.but i am facing the following issues in the phone -1. Charging this phone is taking longer time then ther other fast charging phones used to take, also it is getting heat up a little bit.2. Front Camera is really very bad, if you try to zoom the selfies even a little bit the picture will be scattered.3. It is hanging once you try to do multitasking.

Not worth the price

This is a great phone- excellent camera, decent battery life. But one big problem there is no insurance or care plus pack offered for this on Amazon. I bought from Amazon but sadly I dropped the phone and had to replace the screen for 21k. It was suprising to see samsung care plus being offered for other samsung phones. Tempered glass renders the fingerprint reader inactive and hence only screen guards can be used, which offers some basic protection. I hope people thinking of buying this phone read this review and actually go to a retail outlet which provides the care package for this phone. Trust me you need it. I am told you can get the samsung care pack within 1 month of purchase of online but who wants to go thru all that hassle. Other than the fragile screen, one other complaint I have about the phone camera is you can't shoot slow motion video with zoom. IPhone 13 offers this. The feature I love about this phone is S-Pen, its great for whiteboarding on office calls or taking notes.

Okayish phone but WAY over priced!!

I bought this product purely for photography purpose. But it's nonhood than any ordinary quality. It's optical zoom of 10x is not of good quality at all. The digital zoom upto 100x is a sham. The details get completely lost even in photos taken in normal mode. The battery discharges very fast, especially when the camera is activated. The camera gets heated up fast too.

A Good cellphone but as per it's price and specification, battery installed is inappropriate.
","
Almost everything about this phone is perfect. The screen, the speed, the connectivity, the call quality, Dex interface, the cameras (best picture quality i have seen in a while) are all amazing that you can't praise them enough.However, the Snapdragon 8 gen 1 is the worst choice of chipset for this beauty. If this had packed the 8+ gen 1, it would have been on a different level. The phone heats to 41° with just about 15 mins of gaming. And the processor is so inefficient that the power usage is high. 5000 mah drains fast and doesn't charge fast enough. Yes this is a criticism of the chipset but the phone comes with it. So the brunt falls on the phone.Overall, am not happy with this purchase. I wanted this phone to be an all-rounder, which it isn't. The heat and the battery drain just spoil the entire experience. Hopefully the next iteration would redeem itself. But I am stuck with this phone for now at least sadly.

Great phone with its own probs

Somehow the photos don't give a sharpness and seem to be disappointing bearing in mind a 108MP. They appear pixilated and more like a oil pastel pic when zoomed. My Samsung S10+ did a 10 times better job in pics. I'm I the only one facing this problem? I took it to the store, but the retail guys try to convince me with their crappy sales pitch that it clicks the way it is supposed to. I also took it to the service centre, they said the larger the size of the screen, and higher the resolution, it impacts the output. Besides, if clicked in an indoor environment and decent lights if gives a very normal/standard output, they say you need to click outdoor to get that clarity (which has more natural lighting)- that made no sense to me as I never had this issue in my S10+. I'm not convinced after spending so much.

Good Purchase but a disappointment that they follow apple and don't deliver the charger

Firstly, coming from iPhone, I found camera to be way too superior compared to iPhone.  Especially when it comes to zooming clicks.When it comes to ease of use, it's good overall. But OS smoothness is not that good compared to OnePlus's Oxygen OS. Apps download and installation takes a lot of time when compared to iPhone and OnePlus.There have been several events where I found apps close down automatically when you start using them. Maybe a software update might help on this. There have been events where the phone has lagged as well.Earlier I had OnePlus 7T Pro 2 years back and that phone was damn smooth and never did it lag at all not did any of the apps crashed u like Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.These were few instances where this phone has disappointed me quite a bit. All these issues can be resolved via software update. So hoping Samsung team might look into it and do the needful.Design is stunning and so is the S Pen.This phone has great aesthetics of how a super phone design should be. Now my mom uses my OnePlus 7T Pro phone and occasionally when I use it, it's too fast even being on Android 11. So, come on Samsung and fix the bugs. We have put so much of trust and money in this phone so we deserve the best experience from the phone of such a name.Rest, I will update my review after I get an OS update to see if the bugs are removed.Thanks!

Camera top notch

I have been using the phone since 10+ days now, and it's been a fantastic experience. This is my first S series phone, that also comes with S-Pen so first Note series as well 😀.Performance:It's buttery smooth as expected from a flagship phone. RAM is pretty much occupied by system but I didn't found any issue while day to day use, and ain't a heavy user as well so can't comment about gaming performance.Battery: it doesn't feel like 5000 mah. Need to charge every morning, sometimes before sleeping at night. Hope Samsung fix it by software update.Camera:Tuning of camera is done very accurately by Samsung. Color levels, exposure, HDR..everything feels perfect. Zoom is extraordinary and perfectly usable till 30x-50x. Still haven't got opportunity for testing the camera in different environments, will update later for that.Accessories:I have applied Spigen screen protector on screen so fingerprint reader is working same as on naked screen, and S-Pen is also working fine I would say (Not smooth as on glass, but perfectly usable).Spigen Liquid Air cover is just perfect to hold the S22 ultra, as it provides extra grip on the sides.Even though it's costlier, I would recommend to buy who has budget for this ULTRA flagship. You will just love it!! 😍

इसमें सब चीजें अच्छी है, स्क्रीन की क्वालिटी, कैमरा की क्वालिटी, सॉफ्टवेयर का यूजर इंटरफेस एंड एक्सपीरियंस, स्मूदनेस, फोन का डिजाइन, इन सब चीजों में iphone को टक्कर देता है, लेकिन यह करते-करते आधे दिन में ही बेचारा दम तोड़ देता है और मुझे चारजर ढूंढना पड़ता है. और उस वक्त लगता है कि एप्पल लेता तो अच्छा होता.This is a powerful and inefficient beast. Where as iphone is powerful and extremely efficient beast.Dear Samsung the reason for mobile device is the freedom, the mobility it provides and if your device hangs users to the charger, then we will use more powerful computers instead.यह देखो, रिव्यु लिखते लिखते 3% बैटरी गिर गई.यहां से नीचे का रिव्यू 4 महीने इस्तमाल करने के बाद लिख रहा हूं।तो अनुभव कुछ ऐसा है..की फोन तो भाई मख्खन जैसा है..(लिया भी तो बहुत सारा पैसा है..)अभिभी चिकनापन इसका जैसा का तैसा है।ये फोन दिन ब दोन बेहतरीन होता जा राहा है. अब बॅटरी लाईफ का रिफैंड हुई है. आराम से 5-6 घंटे का Screen on time मिलता है। मुझे अब बैटरी लाइफ से कोई शिकायत नहीं है।बस 1 कमी है जो सैमसंग सॉफ्टवेयर अपडेट से ठीक कर सकता है। वीडियो में शार्पनिंग ज्यादा है जो बहुत आर्टिफिशियल लगता है। बस उतना ठीक करवा दो।बाकी सब चंगा है। 😄

The only improvement that could be done is a better battery life. I'm getting about 5.5 hours of on-screen time. Apart from that, its perfect in terms of performance,  camera, software, everything! Love the haptic feedback and Samsung promised 4 years of updates. I'm very happy.

S22 ultra is simply the best out there.Pros :1) butter smooth & crisp wqhd display.2) The best camera setup. Photos are close to real. The camera app also provides lots of modes making it the phone dslr. Also has lots of pre built modes.3) Audio is very good and supports ATMOS4) Spen experience is first for me and I really liked it.Cons:1)Except for the battery and slight heating issues this phone is easily the best available in market .

Build quality: 5/5Camera: 4.5/5Battery: 4/5Display: 5/5Multitasking: 5/5Gaming: 4/5Upgraded from my Note 20 Ultra(Exynos), hence all points awarded above are as compared to my erstwhile phone.Purchased this during the Amazon Sale for 78K, and it's a steal at this price point.Definitely the best of what Android has to offer, can't beat the iPhone 13 pro max on battery, but it does better than most Samsung phones.Owned and reviewed S2, S3, Note 5, S8 plus, S10 plus, Note10 plus, Note 20 Ultra along with iphone 4, iPhone 7 plus & iphone 11..Pair it with ESR case and Casodon screen guard.

Mobile was awesome

The phone is a beast no questions asked. It worth the every penny you spend. Everything is above the scale:- fast, Snappy.Design is what stood out the most for me though its not much of a difference from it predeccssor still its feels out of the box to hold.Performance is as it should be, best in the game, With Snapdragon 8 gen 1 processor there is alot of a talk about heating however there is no such case with this phone. No matter how heavy user you are or how intense gaming you do this phone handles it all with a ease.Camera:- When i purchased this phone i was really looking forward to experience the camera it offers, If you compare this with best in market iphone 13 pro max, then you wont be disappointed, it offers similar camera quality or in some conditions even better. The dynamic range, saturation, portrait shots all are excellenet in day light. Its nightography function is also extremely good. Talking about video capabilities it offers 8k at 30fps and all other similar in market, its VDIS and OIS feature does make your video rich, steady with prefect light balance. Just like its predecssor this also offers superzoom 100x But all i can add is till 30x its perfectly good after that samsung needs to work on it. Perhaps in next 4-5 years we might be able to have 100x as clear as 30x zoom feature.S Pen:- latency has been reduced to 2.8s which is the super best i can say and also the air gestures is quite fun to use and you can do quite alot with your spen like signing your pdf document on your phone itself without worrying about to get a copy and then signing it.  Using S pen also gets the premium vibe to you in day to day uses it feels bossy.Battery life:- its Good can be better on day to day heavy uses it gets 7-8 hours of screen on time which i feel is already good but its competitor 13 pro max has much better battery compare to it. That generally offers 10 -11 hours of uses which is insane. I would ask samsung to focus on its battery this will generally lead to out perform even apple.Everything else is the best no competition design, performance, One UI, camera, S pen and display. This is phone of the year

One of the best android phone ever in current time.1. Screen quality is amazing. (Ultimate brightness) PPI is less  than oneplus 7pro.2. Build quality is awsome No doubt.3. Speaker is good and louder. But compared to oneplus 7pro  i think littlebit lesser sound.4. Camera perfomance is outstanding. Best part is never colour  shifted when you switching the camera between ultra  wide,telephoto,main sensor etc.5. Charging is too lazy, Almost 1 hour 50mins to need.(25watt)6. Reverse charging support.7. Call quality is good no problem on any network. (Depends on  your area)8. Haptic feedback is love. Little better than oneplus 7 pro.9. Bluetooth earphone/headphone output is oaky not so good  Can't hear any heavy bass. That point oneplus 7  pro is beast. (I'm using Sony WI-XB400)10. S22 ultra currently run on android 13 &one UI 5.0 under  beta version but out of the box you get android 12.11. Battary draining too fast but it will be okay after 2-3 weeks  of useges.12. S-pen work very well.

Phone is defective, battery is draning and headphone is not working.  Amazon got the products tested and they accepted the phone is not working properly.  After, I asked replacement on  Oct 15, 2022 and then replacement order came on Oct 22, 2022. Delivery executive asked charger for the replacement even though there is no charger inside the box !!! and as a result he rejected replacement. After I connected with Amazon customer care, they sent the second delivery for replacement on 28 Oct. The second person did not know how to check IMEI of the phone !!,  he checked everything he again rejected to replace defective phone with the new one.  Now replacement order was cancelled by Amazon without giving any reason. I tried to connect with customer care too many times  and I asked their concern team just to replace defective phone with a new one. Amazon left the customer behind and did not provide any solution.  Item is defective and I asked only replacement. Amazon did not want to replace it accordingly.  I felt cheated by Amazon and the Seller. I was only asking replacement with properly working phone.  I do not recommend to buy this phone as it is premium model and the seller, Samsung and Amazon did not provide enough service to fix the issue. It is just headache and stress.

 I wouldn't know if the phone is any good or not as I received a defective piece and Amazon is not replacing it.The zoom lenses don't work in low light, there is no focus and the shots are bad quality. Even in daylight, the video keeps getting out of focus. On top of it, there's extreme heating issue. Even though I only used the phone to test all features, it got heated up within 10 minutes of use. I reported this immediately within the return/replacement window, they assigned a technician to look into it and after assuring that it will be replaced, they have ghosted me. They keep saying ""we've escalated your report"". It's been a month since I've purchased it.Samsung is not willing to address it, saying that since this purchase is via Amazon, only they can handle it as per their terms.This phone was way out of my budget and it's useless. My OnePlus 7T captures better pictures, videos.If it's an expensive product, avoid buying from Amazon and rather try the phone at the store and buy directly there.

Before I review the device, this is available for much lower price (without offer). But I have ordered this device with offers (assuming smart watch would be provided for the extra price 17K paid compared to the other seller).  I agree nothing is mentioned in the Description, but the samsung store is selling the bundle 22 ultra and galaxy 4  with the same price as 109999.  In the questions about the product mentioned samsung India (the manufacturer) has mentioned multiple times that Galaxy watch is included and I have chosen this model because of this. Now I can't return the device until I find an issue with the mobile and ended up paying 17K extra for no reason. When I call amazon customer care they told me to check with samsung as the comments are made by samsung in the questions section. When I check with samsung they satI have to call up amazon since I made the purchase from amazon.!  Appario Retail ..please correct the discrepancy and help me get the rightful value by Enabling Me to buy the Galaxy watch with the offer price of the bundle (as mentioned by Samsung India)

I ordered the product on 22nd September. Got it delivered on 27th September. Put the SIM card on 28th September.From that day, fingerprint is not working at all. Then I thought, I'll get it replaced which was there in the policy. Amazon changed the policy itself. They changed the policy direct to return the product, not replaced.I went to Samsung store to get it checked. They put the IMEI number in their portal & got to know that phone was activated on 22nd September itself. Someone else from Jammu & Kashmir had put the SIM card in this phone & would have used it.I called Amazon customer care & no resolution till today. They are asking me to return which is also comes under my loss.My request is to get this replaced on priority. Hope they will see this review & reply back at least somewhere.

These brands sell their ""flagships"" on a premium cost, each having a different charging port specifications, and yet decides not to include the essential adaptor.On top that, they have the audacity to call this decision as a pro environment decision when in reality we would be forced to purchase the adaptor separately, inviting more plastic waste.A one star is the least consumers can do against this corporate bs.

Worst battery life
","
When i bought s22 ultra 5g (512gb variant), there was mentioned that I will be eligible for a 7 day replacement only If the need arise as such. The phone was working good but there was some heating issue with this phone. I contacted the AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE and there they replied "" Only 2 phones are left out and hands we cannot replace your profuct"". My simple question1. If 2 phones are left out then why am I not prioritized, because I have already paid for a phone which is not working up to its rank in full amount of front a week before.  I never asked for the refund then why am I not allowed to replace my product.2.  If this kind of situations are going to happen then why do Amazon boast of a 7 day ""replacement only"" guarantee if  a genuine need arise as such However Amazon is kind enough to take a return of my phone and to refund the amount, But this is not a shopping experience where a high valued customer would really desire, wherein a hefty amount is being locked for so long without even customer satisfaction.

this phone i have bought for 1lac rupees just after reading the great review on its performance but the truth is revealed to me once i have received the handset.If you are buying one phone which costs you arround 1Lac rupees then in my opinion we should not compromise the performance of the product.but i am facing the following issues in the phone -1. Charging this phone is taking longer time then ther other fast charging phones used to take, also it is getting heat up a little bit.2. Front Camera is really very bad, if you try to zoom the selfies even a little bit the picture will be scattered.3. It is hanging once you try to do multitasking.

This is a great phone- excellent camera, decent battery life. But one big problem there is no insurance or care plus pack offered for this on Amazon. I bought from Amazon but sadly I dropped the phone and had to replace the screen for 21k. It was suprising to see samsung care plus being offered for other samsung phones. Tempered glass renders the fingerprint reader inactive and hence only screen guards can be used, which offers some basic protection. I hope people thinking of buying this phone read this review and actually go to a retail outlet which provides the care package for this phone. Trust me you need it. I am told you can get the samsung care pack within 1 month of purchase of online but who wants to go thru all that hassle. Other than the fragile screen, one other complaint I have about the phone camera is you can't shoot slow motion video with zoom. IPhone 13 offers this. The feature I love about this phone is S-Pen, its great for whiteboarding on office calls or taking notes.

I bought this product purely for photography purpose. But it's nonhood than any ordinary quality. It's optical zoom of 10x is not of good quality at all. The digital zoom upto 100x is a sham. The details get completely lost even in photos taken in normal mode. The battery discharges very fast, especially when the camera is activated. The camera gets heated up fast too.

A Good cellphone but as per it's price and specification, battery installed is inappropriate.

Almost everything about this phone is perfect. The screen, the speed, the connectivity, the call quality, Dex interface, the cameras (best picture quality i have seen in a while) are all amazing that you can't praise them enough.However, the Snapdragon 8 gen 1 is the worst choice of chipset for this beauty. If this had packed the 8+ gen 1, it would have been on a different level. The phone heats to 41° with just about 15 mins of gaming. And the processor is so inefficient that the power usage is high. 5000 mah drains fast and doesn't charge fast enough. Yes this is a criticism of the chipset but the phone comes with it. So the brunt falls on the phone.Overall, am not happy with this purchase. I wanted this phone to be an all-rounder, which it isn't. The heat and the battery drain just spoil the entire experience. Hopefully the next iteration would redeem itself. But I am stuck with this phone for now at least sadly.

Somehow the photos don't give a sharpness and seem to be disappointing bearing in mind a 108MP. They appear pixilated and more like a oil pastel pic when zoomed. My Samsung S10+ did a 10 times better job in pics. I'm I the only one facing this problem? I took it to the store, but the retail guys try to convince me with their crappy sales pitch that it clicks the way it is supposed to. I also took it to the service centre, they said the larger the size of the screen, and higher the resolution, it impacts the output. Besides, if clicked in an indoor environment and decent lights if gives a very normal/standard output, they say you need to click outdoor to get that clarity (which has more natural lighting)- that made no sense to me as I never had this issue in my S10+. I'm not convinced after spending so much.

Good Purchase but a disappointment that they follow apple and don't deliver the charger

Firstly, coming from iPhone, I found camera to be way too superior compared to iPhone.  Especially when it comes to zooming clicks.When it comes to ease of use, it's good overall. But OS smoothness is not that good compared to OnePlus's Oxygen OS. Apps download and installation takes a lot of time when compared to iPhone and OnePlus.There have been several events where I found apps close down automatically when you start using them. Maybe a software update might help on this. There have been events where the phone has lagged as well.Earlier I had OnePlus 7T Pro 2 years back and that phone was damn smooth and never did it lag at all not did any of the apps crashed u like Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.These were few instances where this phone has disappointed me quite a bit. All these issues can be resolved via software update. So hoping Samsung team might look into it and do the needful.Design is stunning and so is the S Pen.This phone has great aesthetics of how a super phone design should be. Now my mom uses my OnePlus 7T Pro phone and occasionally when I use it, it's too fast even being on Android 11. So, come on Samsung and fix the bugs. We have put so much of trust and money in this phone so we deserve the best experience from the phone of such a name.Rest, I will update my review after I get an OS update to see if the bugs are removed.Thanks!

Camera top notch

I have been using the phone since 10+ days now, and it's been a fantastic experience. This is my first S series phone, that also comes with S-Pen so first Note series as well 😀.Performance:It's buttery smooth as expected from a flagship phone. RAM is pretty much occupied by system but I didn't found any issue while day to day use, and ain't a heavy user as well so can't comment about gaming performance.Battery: it doesn't feel like 5000 mah. Need to charge every morning, sometimes before sleeping at night. Hope Samsung fix it by software update.Camera:Tuning of camera is done very accurately by Samsung. Color levels, exposure, HDR..everything feels perfect. Zoom is extraordinary and perfectly usable till 30x-50x. Still haven't got opportunity for testing the camera in different environments, will update later for that.Accessories:I have applied Spigen screen protector on screen so fingerprint reader is working same as on naked screen, and S-Pen is also working fine I would say (Not smooth as on glass, but perfectly usable).Spigen Liquid Air cover is just perfect to hold the S22 ultra, as it provides extra grip on the sides.Even though it's costlier, I would recommend to buy who has budget for this ULTRA flagship. You will just love it!! 😍

Where as iphone is powerful and extremely efficient beast.Dear Samsung the reason for mobile device is the freedom, the mobility it provides and if your device hangs users to the charger, then we will use more powerful computers instead.यह देखो, रिव्यु लिखते लिखते 3% बैटरी गिर गई.यहां से नीचे का रिव्यू 4 महीने इस्तमाल करने के बाद लिख रहा हूं।तो अनुभव कुछ ऐसा है..की फोन तो भाई मख्खन जैसा है..(लिया भी तो बहुत सारा पैसा है..)अभिभी चिकनापन इसका जैसा का तैसा है।ये फोन दिन ब दोन बेहतरीन होता जा राहा है. अब बॅटरी लाईफ का रिफैंड हुई है. आराम से 5-6 घंटे का Screen on time मिलता है। मुझे अब बैटरी लाइफ से कोई शिकायत नहीं है।बस 1 कमी है जो सैमसंग सॉफ्टवेयर अपडेट से ठीक कर सकता है। वीडियो में शार्पनिंग ज्यादा है जो बहुत आर्टिफिशियल लगता है। बस उतना ठीक करवा दो।बाकी सब चंगा है। 😄

Best of the Best Phones

S22 ultra is simply the best out there.Pros :1) butter smooth & crisp wqhd display.2) The best camera setup. Photos are close to real. The camera app also provides lots of modes making it the phone dslr. Also has lots of pre built modes.3) Audio is very good and supports ATMOS4) Spen experience is first for me and I really liked it.Cons:1)Except for the battery and slight heating issues this phone is easily the best available in market .

Build quality: 5/5Camera: 4.5/5Battery: 4/5Display: 5/5Multitasking: 5/5Gaming: 4/5Upgraded from my Note 20 Ultra(Exynos), hence all points awarded above are as compared to my erstwhile phone.Purchased this during the Amazon Sale for 78K, and it's a steal at this price point.Definitely the best of what Android has to offer, can't beat the iPhone 13 pro max on battery, but it does better than most Samsung phones.Owned and reviewed S2, S3, Note 5, S8 plus, S10 plus, Note10 plus, Note 20 Ultra along with iphone 4, iPhone 7 plus & iphone 11..Pair it with ESR case and Casodon screen guard.

Mobile was awesome

The phone is a beast no questions asked. It worth the every penny you spend. Everything is above the scale:- fast, Snappy.Design is what stood out the most for me though its not much of a difference from it predeccssor still its feels out of the box to hold.Performance is as it should be, best in the game, With Snapdragon 8 gen 1 processor there is alot of a talk about heating however there is no such case with this phone. No matter how heavy user you are or how intense gaming you do this phone handles it all with a ease.Camera:- When i purchased this phone i was really looking forward to experience the camera it offers, If you compare this with best in market iphone 13 pro max, then you wont be disappointed, it offers similar camera quality or in some conditions even better. The dynamic range, saturation, portrait shots all are excellenet in day light. Its nightography function is also extremely good. Talking about video capabilities it offers 8k at 30fps and all other similar in market, its VDIS and OIS feature does make your video rich, steady with prefect light balance. Just like its predecssor this also offers superzoom 100x But all i can add is till 30x its perfectly good after that samsung needs to work on it. Perhaps in next 4-5 years we might be able to have 100x as clear as 30x zoom feature.S Pen:- latency has been reduced to 2.8s which is the super best i can say and also the air gestures is quite fun to use and you can do quite alot with your spen like signing your pdf document on your phone itself without worrying about to get a copy and then signing it.  Using S pen also gets the premium vibe to you in day to day uses it feels bossy.Battery life:- its Good can be better on day to day heavy uses it gets 7-8 hours of screen on time which i feel is already good but its competitor 13 pro max has much better battery compare to it. That generally offers 10 -11 hours of uses which is insane. I would ask samsung to focus on its battery this will generally lead to out perform even apple.Everything else is the best no competition design, performance, One UI, camera, S pen and display. This is phone of the year

I have been using this phone since 28th September, 2022 and am very happy with it.The camera is excellent, took a very clear picture if the moon on Sharad Poornima. Even otherwise, the camera is excellent.Battery life is also good, it lasts for more than 1.5 days for me. Very fast processor and the SPen is really awesome!Go for it if budget permits.All the best!

One of the best android phone ever in current time.1. Screen quality is amazing. (Ultimate brightness) PPI is less  than oneplus 7pro.2. Build quality is awsome No doubt.3. Speaker is good and louder. But compared to oneplus 7pro  i think littlebit lesser sound.4. Camera perfomance is outstanding. Best part is never colour  shifted when you switching the camera between ultra  wide,telephoto,main sensor etc.5. Charging is too lazy, Almost 1 hour 50mins to need.(25watt)6. Reverse charging support.7. Call quality is good no problem on any network. (Depends on  your area)8. Haptic feedback is love. Little better than oneplus 7 pro.9. Bluetooth earphone/headphone output is oaky not so good  Can't hear any heavy bass. That point oneplus 7  pro is beast. (I'm using Sony WI-XB400)10. S22 ultra currently run on android 13 &one UI 5.0 under  beta version but out of the box you get android 12.11. Battary draining too fast but it will be okay after 2-3 weeks  of useges.12. S-pen work very well.

Bought flip4 a month ago, last night left it closed on table and next morning I open and saw a black line at the centre, within few hours almost whole of the screen is having dead pixels. No drops, no mishandling, had bumper case and Samsung’s preapplied screen protector too, still this happened. Contacted customer care and they said it’s “impact damage”.. not sure what it meant even when the phone was not dropped. Worst part I have to pay for display change which will be about Rs30k. Poor quality display. Consider yourself lucky if phone lasts few months. Never recommend this phone to anyone. Thought Samsung products will be better but I was wrong and it’s costing me a heavy amount to trust Samsung. Should have gone for apple if I am paying such high amount with 0 reliability.

Order I''d: 1069092657The phone has never been dropped or banged or even scratched till date. 2 days ago, out of nowhere a black spot appeared on top right side of my phone. The image of the screen error has been attached for your reference.There are no signs of physical or water damage on the phone. There is not even a single scratch on the device. Even after this Samsung Service center refused repair the phone. According to the service center the handset is damaged due to improper usage. However, during my visit to service center they couldn''t find any signs of physical damage. Even after that they refused to give me benefit of warranty.I have Phone recording of Samsung official where they agreed that there was no physical damage in phone. Even after that the job report of service center states that the warranty is void since the phone was physically damaged due to improper usage. I will be sharing this recording in all social media websites so that every one will come to know how Samsung is cheating their Foldable Customers. Samsung official Gunjan Sharma was coordinating with me.I am sharing the photos of my device which clearly shows there is no physical damage till date.How come Samsung service center is refusing to repair my phone under warranty when it can be clearly seen that there is some fault with device.I don''t think I will buy any Samsung product again after facing such horrible experience even though I am one of their premium smart phone customer.I want my foldable device to get repaired under warranty as this is clearly faulty piece. Otherwise, I will definitely take this issue to higher level and even on social media sites so that people will know how faulty Samsung''s foldable devices are. Also, how poorly Samsung''s customer service treats their foldable customers.KINDLY TAKE THIS ISSUE AS MOST URGENT. I CAN DEFINETLY ASSURE YOU THAT ATLEAST PROSPECT SAMSUNG CUSTOMERS WOULD NOT BE BUYING THEIR NEXT PHONE FROM SAMSUNG.

The motherboard and IC is damaged after one month of use. Samsung says they will repair the phone and give as part of the warranty. Ideally they should have replaced the entire device. Surprised to see this policy by Samsung. Apple has a clear policy to replace the phone if any issue with motherboard. Samsung is failing big time on overall build quality and post sale service.

Worked for 2 years without no issue. After 2 years serious problems- charging issue, display issue etc. New dosplay panel was replaced in authorised samsung service centre by paying around 11223/-. Within 7 days the display panel again created the same problem. There is no authorised service center in my current city. The online samsung customer support is giving round-round reply without any solution. I purchased this mobile specially due to stylus feature. Unfortunately, no other brand (Nokia, Motorola etc) is providing smartphone with stylus feature. Samsung is using benefit of this and looting customers. I have already used Note 2, On max mobiles but my experience with note 10 lite is pathetic now. This is making me not to stick on SAMSUNG products only.

I bought this phone during first lockdown in 2020 basically with a curiosity of the experience of stylus..I was using Oneplus 6 before this, so you can understand what my expectation from this device..Since the beginning the phone was a bit slow.. Even reaching to internal memory i8t used to take time which is hard for me as I was an oneplus user.. I started living with that buffering issue..Usually, when I was using one plus, I was waiting for the software updates as they usually simplify my tasks.. but it is different with SAMSUNG..Few of my OTT channels started going haywire in the month of Feb'21..By this time it is only 9 months old mobile..I used to screw the happiness of HOTSTAR customer care.. I didn't know that this is the problem with mobile but not the OTT.Then, I had this problem of contacts not appearing in mobile..For example, my wife's name is not appearing when she calls me, neither I can see her number in my contacts..Thr funny thing is that, when I called the customer care and informed about my concern.. they access my phone from smart tutor app n say that that particular number is not saved in my contacts..That number is off my wife who is living with me for the last 15 years..And remember.. do not expect to use the phone while it us bring charged.. It'll never respknd. Or will over react..And..lastly.. The issue with over heating..I'm jyst wondering how come SAMSUNG become the number two top seller in India and how people are living with it...l

After 6 months of use:1. The fingerprint sensor sucks. Works 1 out of 5 times, and that too if I keep the finger with great precision. The face recognition works fine but is slower than most phones.2. Battery life is satisfactory. Phone gets super hot, even if you are using it for regular calls and msgs.3. Charging: I love how fast this devices charges up. Superfast.4. The camera is not that good either. Even Vivo/ Oppo provides a better camera at a lesser price. Lacks stability once you zoom in.5. Poor Speakers for watching videos. My previous phone (oneplus5) had better speakers. Even while using speaker phone while on-call; it's just not loud. I mean you can obviously hear the voice, but don't expect that in a room of 5 people, everyone can hear it clearly.6. Processor: Slower than what it should have been. Not sure why they used Note 9's chipset and not the one that they used in S10 lite. Phone's efficiency could have been better if they used a newer chipset in note10 lite.Samsung uses cheap Exynos processor in India.Why buy?Buy this phone only if you want to use the stylus for sketching / taking notes. All other features that are marketed for S pen, are useless. But weigh out your options well - If S-pen is more important than camera/ fingerprint sensor/ phone speed/ battery life/overall performance, then only buy note 10 lite. Else go for any oneplus flagship phone.Conclusion:Personally, After using this phone for 6 months, I think One Plus8 would have been a better option at similar price. And now with newer phones out in market, I think Note 10 lite's price should be reduced to 20k max. Features and performance ain't worth the current price (39k / 35 k post cashback offer).Good luck buying your new phone :)

I have been using this mobile for the past six months before writing this review, earlier I used Honor 7x and I thought I am upgrading myself to a better phone and bought this. Overall the phone doesn't even deserve Rs 4000 pricetag.Switching off frequently - This is the one most common problem, while I'm in-office calls or even when the phone is idle it switches off by itself and then reboots itself. This is one most annoying things you can face on your phone. When I was making a presentation through the mobile, It got switched off and finally, I had to pay the price of buying such a crappy product.Useless fingerprint scanner  - After the first few times, the fingerprint scanner hardly works. I don't remember when I used that facility, whenever I try using finger print it fails miserably.Battery: With Android Auto on for 1 hr, you can expect the charge to come down by 15-20% and If I charge in the morning, I have to recharge by evening.Frequent updates: Software updates come almost every week, it is so annoying if we have to update the phone so frequently.Almost with thrice the cost of my earlier phone , this product delivers way worse than it. Probably this is the first time I am writing such a negative review for a product.Avoid it, at any cost - don't even recommend it for your enemy !!!

Like most of the reviews suggested, stay away if u want a decent selfie cam. Fingerprint reader is a disaster. Somehow my 2yr old phone had better jio and Vodafone 4g signal reception than this phone. Phone came with screen guard applied and Android 11 OTB. Processor and ram will surely lag a little. cannot uninstall some bloatware. My first amoled phone. I think it's overrated. Good quality FHD IPS are the same.After 2weeks use:Signal reception is poor for jio and Vodafone idea compared to any other mobile. Fingerprint reader is nearly useless. Can't enrol more than 3 fingers, since it's suggested to double register a finger, u can practically use only two fingers.Face recognition is not useful except if bright light on face.U can't use phone while being charged. Screen will be stuck as soon as u start typing or when u open a second app.Charging takes 2hours minimum from 20% remaining state. Its type C port takes even longer if I use other Qualcomm 3 chargers. The charger that comes in box doesn't charge other devices.Front camera is a disaster, even a 8k mobile will take better selfies than this.Rear camera is okayish.

This is the worst phone ever and that too in so much cost. I am feeling like I have wasted my money in something worth 10,000/-Old Review - I am feeling bad to buy this phone. Camera and fingerprint sensor is so so bad.Whoever have used any Pixel phone or iphone will surely think to return this phone.I am still keeping this only because of S-pen.

I have purchased a Samsung galaxy note 10 lite mobile by using a hugediscount on it. But the display has purple dots even after 2 days fromthe purchase date 07/02/2021, I have thought that this is due to s penbut then gone automatically. Today Morning, I have again seen a dot atthe bottom side and spreading enormously to the whole screen. within twohour these dots spread to the whole display. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTING, Ihave to face this problem even mobile was not used for a single month.When contacted to service center they told me that this happens due topressure/force application on the screen. but nothing was happened assuch on my mobile. A faulty product was delivered to me. there are manyother issues with this phone like while using the camera slow-motionfeature there are continuous lines coming in the screen in lighting/heating issues etc. I have spent 32k on it. and such a faulty display/mobile was given by Samsung. need better assistance from your side

Do not buy this phone. I saw some reviews regarding it's finger print sensor, I thought there would be a minor glitch but when I used it, it really sucks. Finger print sensor doesn't work. I was fed up and removed it and started using the pin to unlock my phone. The phone is a typical samsung version which is very slow due to it's processor. Spen is fine you can use it but apart from that everything is horrible. Camera is ok not to good no to bad. But the phone lags. After spending 30k if you are getting this then please stop thinking about spen and go for some one plus phones like nord. It has much better display and refresh rate.Frankly speaking I sold out this phone after a week usage. Don't buy it guys that's the worst android phone I have ever used.

U can't capture those.5) Samsung born quality..Hang ..Hang... Hang...Really trapped after 11 days. How will be ur mind if u claim warranty after 11 days. Better go for Redmi , oppo , vivo , iphone...i used all these. For 2 years each. Didn't feel anything. Samsung bad 👎 try to resale in Olx.

Worthless pen

I was continuously watching the reviews of this phone from the time it was launched. I decided to buy this phone on 1st may 21.I knew all the pros and cons of this mobile before buying this mobile. I would like to say that the phone is almost good. Ya, little bit fingerprint reader issue. I have to put my thumb atleast two to three times to unlock. The spen was the main reason to buy this mobile. Spen of this mobile is lacking gyroscope sensors thats why it can't perform air actions and one more thing that this spen works on capacitor so discharge very fast. Overall performance is good till now..I don't know what will happen further.The spen was the main attraction of this mobile and the spen itself is not a complete spen. Some features is missing.At the bottom right the spen is deviating(incorrect touch response) because of magnetic field of speaker. Bad magnetic insulation.So giving 2 stars.

I used that phone from last 10 days.let me tell you something more.1. Too much heavy ,this phone is even haviour than 4 year old one plus 5.Shame on you Samsung.2. This phone has 4500mah battery but if you dont get off always on,bixby & optimise its bettery by enable option. it will get down in 5 hours with normal usage.3 .even though it has fast charger,but it took 90 to100 min in full charging. With normal usage bettery drain fast even in facebook,twitter. my 4 yr old one plus 5 charged faster than it.In Short Samsung gives s- pen but skip all the latest features which are coming in 25-30k phone and we all expected them.please note that this phone don't get fast charge from another charger like  oppo/ one plus fast charger. even 10w charger show 2x time and other brand fast charger not get accepted.With my Normal usage [typical office goer]2-3 hours youtube,netflix1-2 hour social web sitesnormal camera usageno gamingthis phone will serve you 10-12 hours.Think again before investing money on Samsung .They are cheater.For positive points ,you can watch any youtube channel,they took money to sing all positives.

And has already got problems.*The front camera quality is really bad.*The back camera does does focus on objects multiple times when needed.*The phone has already started to hang while using when put for charging.*Been just 2 months and phone is getting heated up slightly now a days.Really disappointed to have paid Rs. 35,999/- on this product. Phone of half the prices are much better than this I feel.Don't go for this particular phone. If needed, try another faster much better phone at the same price or even lesser prices.

YOU HAVE BUILT A BEAUTIFUL HOME BUT THE TWO LOCKS DOESN'T WORK WELL OFTEN. HOW DO YOU FEEL??1. Samsung mobiles come with a black Samsung labelled seal. The seller has put a generic white seal which reads ""Do not accept if seal is broken"". But the original Samsung seal was already tampered by seller. I have raised a complaint with Amazon about the seller, but they just asked me to return.2. This phone has the worst biometrics on earth. It doesn't recognise my face quite often and the fingerprint scanner is very slow which makes you to go to PIN or Pattern. I have used Sony Xperia Z5 and XZ1 Compact before buying this and the fingerprint scanner was just quick.3. The proximity sensor is so dumb that it doesn't detect when I pick the phone.

Not recommended

Pros :1. Tower reception and call quality.2. Camera. Night mode and lowlight response excellent.3. Good for orthodox requirement.4.Stylus penCons:1. Slow. Felt the difference with snapdragon processor.2. Typing response weak, smart typing should be better.3. Disastrous finger print and face unlock response4. Screenshot option should be more user friendly. Bixby can be used but not in every situation.Bixby shortcut command not friendly.5. 24k should have been a competitive price.6. Proximity sensor does not respond well.7. In-built call recorder does not function well.8. Phone hangs while receiving calls.9. Reported issues to Samsung helpline but their only solution is phone reset.

If you are bored of typical phones and want to try s pen go for it.It has many cons. Battery, processor speed, finger. S pen sensitivity also low sometime. Battery hotupdate 18-07-2021:- Going to sell this and use another new phone- I was using a 2018 gaming phone vivo nex s befor i purchase this samsung- I was aware of the limitations before purchasing this phone (purchased only for s pen)- Not worth it, bug, laggy, sluggish- Changing to 2 start from 3 star

I love my phone BUTIt over heatsIt heats a lot. I don't think it's something you would expect from a 42k phone!I love the stylus, the design of the phone and the color is so beautiful ^.^But it's heating issue upsets me a lot :(I put all my savings on this phone. It was my dream to buy a phone like this. I convinced my parents. I was super duper excited. But i was disappointed to find that it heats this much from first day. I even talked to technical expert from amazon and they said it's normal. I want to cry.But I'm try my best to look only on the positives but its an issue that i cannot overlook :(

hey amazon when price is 41999 why you sold it at 43999rs??  i loss 2k it's not right.and the phone is avarageProsser is old but it's not that bad i am OnePlus 6 and note 10 lite performance little better than 845 mainly when playing pubg.rear camera is good not the best but good enough.front camera is to much soft and loose complete details in low light, then plastic back is not look that bad as YouTube reviews shows and i feel it's safe have 0 breaking chance.  and the main big issue unlock the phone with finger print and face both are just worst..at the price of 43999rs (what i paid) even a 15 rs ph have better in display fingerprint sensor and face unlock.we cannot expect it from samsung type of brand Samsung evry time given the worst thing to there customer if they have to sell something at low cost..evry samsung phone ander 60k is just worst about this specs..samsung you need to improve don't do marketing with by only brand value. give us value for money products.

S Pen and battery  both of them are very poor

Bought this phone after lot of hesitations ,because lot of negative reviews about finger print scanner,and camera quality,but i bought this last week.as sais by many reviews it had fingerprint scanner issues and about front camera quality,it was worst than basic 15000 k mobiles..but rear camera was AWESOME.but got an update ,after that FP scanner got improved well but had some glitches at times,annoyed a lot and front camera quality also got an improvemnta BIT only..but i was satisfied with wat i had received and decided to move on with the same quality,but after 4 days of uasge,4G network was not getting connected (only 2 G)did  tried all lot of stuffs to crct ,not resolved.finally went to service center,as usual problem was not resolved and ROUTINE mother board problem was diagnosed.THEY did offered me replacement at once based on brand warrenty.but i refused and retuned the product to amazon itself.am first tym user of S PEN ,it was FANTASTIC and feature backed.ONE UI is also SUPERB UI skin,than OXYGEN OS(personal exp).so ,compromise for front camera(above avg quality,only low light photography was bad,FP scanner gave a mixed feeling) and buy at ur own preferneces.IF THAT NETWORK ISSUES WASNT THR,SURE I WOULDNT HAVE RETURNED IT

Not worth for Money

Only few plus points: S-pen, Rear Camera, good software security - Samsung Knox.Processor speed is average. Phone does not hangs, can play big games easily.Rear camera is very good. Front camera is bad.Finger print and face unlock are very poor.Software updates are regularly provided.

Good product , my only dislikes would be the fingerprint scanner and front camera

It's good... Not what I expected... S pen features are awesome..back cameras are good but front camera is very bad in low-light..my old mi a3 is better in front cam..One bad thing is that there is no proper gcam as it has Exynos processor..The fingerprint reader after applying tempered glass from local store doesn't work.. even the proximity sensor doesn't work... So apply tempered glass in Samsung stores...those are good...

Recommend only who need S Pen

Let's keep it simple.Pros:1. S-Pen2. Good display for the price3. Processor not too bad4. S-Pen, yes, it's that goodCons:1. Camera (They are saying it has gotten better in One UI 2.5, waiting for it)2. Battery (They said, the battery will adapt to usage. It's been only 3 days)3. Fingerprint scanner (I registered the same thumb thrice and yet couldn't improve time. Maybe they can fix it with a software update)Why buy it? Simple; for an affordable S-Pen experience. Otherwise, go for S10 lite. Much better camera and battery.Btw, this is my first non-flagship buy so I may have kept my hopes just a teensy bit high.

only for stylus and camera
","
As all other reviews mention, the fingerprint reader and face unlock suck. They are super slow and don't even detect them most of the time. I tried the workaround with adding multiple copies of my fingerprint but it's still annoying. However the Knox UI and multitasking is really good and the S pen is really fun to use so if biometrics is not a problem for you it's a great phone.

Go for it... if video section is not required

Phone is good, battery is very poor. cannot even  last a day with full charge. no gaming at all and multimedia usage is also very less  then too it cannot last a day. S Pen is fair. But at times it does not detects the screen.Rest display  is good. Features are okay. Selfie camera is also poor. Finger print is slow unusually.

Review after 3 months usage.Display is brilliant,Battery is Good,Performance is Good,Premium look.S-Pen Works Fine.If you are looking for Camera,Don't buy this mobile.Camera Performance is not perfect at this price.Very poor camera comparing other in this same segment.This mobile camera performance is not meets our expectation.Not as much as performance, what they are mention in camera spec.

Good phone with some minor flaws.
","
- 8GB RAM  it runs fast- Back camera is really good- Battery backup is also good but you are a person who spends maximum time in your phone , opinion may vary.- S pen features are really good. If you are into making notes or drawings  you will love it- I didnt like the front camera because it gives an automatic glow  , i dont know whether there is a way to deactivate it but it is annoying- The on screen fingerprint scanner doesnt work most of the time that is one drawback which i have to highlight.- It does charge fast , takes  1 hour for full charging but reaches 60% in 20 minutes , the fast charging is not as good as the one plus 6 fast charging but better battery back than one plus 6.

Overall a good product.

Am not gonna talk about pros n cons abt this phones... but what I really loved about this phone apart from the obvious S  PEN is the phone's CAMERA.. its one of the best camera tat I have used in a very long time.. the clarity the color saturation ...its just amazing.. what I really didn't like is the finger print sensor.. its not upto the mark.. it doesn't read properly. Need a minimum of 2 tries. Annoying sometimes. The next thing tat I noticed is tat the network signals, it drops a lot.The battery back is pretty decent for an average user like me who uses it for business and for takin pictures.. and the SPen as usual its just amazing what all you could do with it its almost limitless.. I would strongly recommend Samsung Galaxy Note 10 lite.. An amazing Phone..

This phones performs back camera super well but not that much on front cam. It gives extreme dull pics on low light condition but some times gives better on fully day light condition as compared to low light condition. And the processor preforms pretty well but some times it gives irritating responce. And some times any water drops on screen the screen will automatically run  up and down and closes and open the apps it very irritating even for a small drops also. And i just using it for S Pen experience the S Pen works amazingly. And the Battery life is also better than compared to other which is have the specifications. And the last one fingerprint sensor is worst that i ever been used my previous one's it opens a bit delay and it can't open for some times except these every thing is good.

Great performance, great battery!!!

finger print sensor doesnt work at all.. tried many timescamera is good, you can see in the picturebattery life is also fine till now.. its been a month with the phone. battery usually runs for a day. so its finemain purpose of buying it was the stylus i get along with it. it was the only option i had. though it makes my work easier but it could be better as on the applications i use .. like autodesk sketchbook it keeps changing a few settings that i dont like.also, google chrome hangs a lot on this phone dont know chrome is the problem or the phone is.all in all .. its little high pricedif you want stylus and a good camera then u may consider this phone.else its the usual.

When received the fone, box was damaged as shown. But fone was packed, seems that received a returned fone. Will look for few days n if any issue found will go for replacement.Now reviews,Pros,Awesome looksCamera that includes wide angle alsoS pen the great feature, can also b used as shoot button.Storage, alot of storage space use as much as you canVery fast charging, if you have less time and battery is low 5-10 mins charge will give you ample time to spend with your fone.Battery with normal use stays awhile, not tried with game yetConsA bit lag when disabling some appsOutdated processorVery disappointed with the video section, slowmo in normal light is very bad.Heat up a bit quicker than other fonesVideo recording requires a lot of light

Excellent smartphone for multitaskers :-)
","
Initially, fingerprint reader was very slow, but after a few updates, it has become good. So, no problem there. Camera is really good and it's best for someone who does manual photography with full fledged manual controls which you won't get in S10 lite. The main thing which makes this phone stabd out from others is S pen and it's great if you start using it for professional as well as personal wokr. This Exynos processor is not for someone who does a lot of gaming but in terms of multitasking I've faced no problems in the last 1-2 months. Battery works okay. I get around 7 hours screen time and charging time is approx.80 minutes. So, if you are looking for a non-Chinese phone this will be one of the best choices for you.

Really Suits me

Review after 20 days of use:Overall look of the phone is good. Red colour is a little darker than what your see in the image but still rich colour. S pen is a major plus point. You can do a lot of good things with it. Camera quality is excellent. Both front and back cameras give pretty good picture quality. Some in built Samsung apps are also very helpful. Battery life is average but will last one entire day with moderate use. Charging is very fast, so it compensates for average battery life. Fingerprint scanner is pathetic. It will read only 60% of the times. It did improve after a few days but still not upto the mark. Overall you get a nice note experience at a cheaper price. Lastly Amazon delivery boy was helpful.

The night shots by selfie camera are not upto the mark. The day shots are fabulous by every camera. Many have uploaded selfies which are not good to see, I have not faced any issues in proper lighting. S pen works brilliantly well. Fingerprint reader is a bit slow as compared to other devices of this price range but it works okay. Rear cameras are best in segment for photos as well as videos. The processor is 2 years old but doesn't feel so after 4 updates too.

It's a very good phone. The screen quality is very good, the battery is pretty decent, easily lasts a a full day, the performance is also very good, the camera quality is pretty good. The only issue is probably the in display finger print scanner - at times it doesn't work properly. But overall very happy with the purchase.

Best Flagship Level Smartphone.
","
I have been using it now for a month, i believe i can now sum up the features and performances. Cameras are great, but i prefer the shots without auto hdr which tends to over blow the colours. Battery is super fantastic with unnecessary features turned off. I would like to give it a full five star but... the fingerprint sensor is not too responsive compared to a stand alone sensor so registering my fingerprint was quite a task. Apart from that, it is all positive

Note experience at a budget
","
I love my new galaxy note10 lite. S pen features are available at an affordable price is the best thing about the phone. Phone as such is overall fast with very minimal hanging . Back camera is also excellent with good macro and micro picture quality though front camera is not up to the mark. Front camera gives low quality images in indoor lighting though it can be improved by using other camera apps. The feature I hate ,the only one ,in my phone is its finger print sensor which I'd often felt was such a joke. It'd failed to read my fingerprint in some crucial, emergency situations. If this could get fixed I would definitely tell this phone to be the best phone at the best price

Happy with the purchase. MUST BUY!!!!

Excellent smartphone for people who want to do multi task. The phone has very good UI which gives easy access for the applications. There are lot of fantastic things in the mobile......especially the pen function which makes it over the edge phone than other models. I will not get in the technical aspects as it's already there in the description of the mobile. Just make sure you configure fingerprint at time of set up, if you do it later it may not give desired results.This mobile is straight competition for lot of smartphone brands and best part is it's more economical and better than those.Go ahead and buy this phone......you will not regret on Ur decision.

Have u used Notelite10, if not, u r missing

Haven't had the addiction to use the Spen yet for daily use. But the screen and the battery life seems good.Especially the convenient Power mode can be used in the night time to extend the batter life.Overall it feels good to use a Samsung mobile again after trying other brands for 2 years. It gives me the pure flagship feeling and worth the money especially as I could avail the 5K Citibank discount offer too.The transparent cover with the device has a good grip. I preferred this free cover when compared to an after market cover than i purchased for around 400 INR in parallel to the device.

Good budget friendly phone for working professionals

It's a great phone overall. I have not faced any issues with battery. Yes the fingerprint is a bit slow but it's nothing compared to the phone itself. If you need an spen (which was my requirement as I have been using this series from Note 2), just go for it. They have a lot more features for the price rather than just the camera and battery. Also it has upgraded to Android 11 with One UI 3.1. O faced a bit heating issue only during these large upgrades. Very satisfied. Worth the price.

A grt phone by Samsung .Overall performance of the phone is grt no lag in daily use games also works  fine.Battery performance is good for normal usage it last for a day. And charge ups quickly. Coming to camera back camera does grt work  cant even imagine picture quality is grt . Front camera also works fine bt needs little improvement in low light conditions. Display is one of the best display i have ever used. The main key features of the phone is secured by knox security now a days it is very important comparing to other Chinese company phones. Rom is also good no blot wears works fine

Bought it for 28K with a heavy discount. You can trust on Samsung as well as Amazon BLINDLY for a worthy product. Front camera is amazing, rare cameras are amazing too. Super fast 25W charger charges it in 70 min from 0 to 100. Battery stays all day with a moderate usage including gamings, browsing and youtube streaming.

I got this phone for the stylus experience and headphone jack port.. the camera quality is really good. One UI is really good and Samsung has done a good work on it over its predecessor TouchWiz.. the signal, battery backup, speaker and fingerprint scanner is average.. but overall u get a good experience with knox security as your data is protected compared to other phones and also samsung pay service. Last but not the least the watching movies or playing videos is of different level due to the super amoled panel. Not found any lags till now after 1 month usage. Even playing pubg for one hr i didn't find any lags
